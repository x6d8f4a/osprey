What is Osprey Framework?
--------------------------

The **Osprey Framework** is a production-ready architecture for deploying agentic AI in large-scale, safety-critical control system environments. Built on :doc:`LangGraph's StateGraph foundation <developer-guides/01_understanding-the-framework/03_langgraph-integration>`, it transforms natural language inputs into transparent, auditable execution plans designed for operational safety and reliability.

Developed for scientific facilities managing complex technical infrastructure such as particle accelerators, fusion experiments, beamlines, and large telescopes, Osprey addresses control-specific challenges: :doc:`semantic addressing across large channel namespaces <getting-started/control-assistant-part2-channel-finder>`, :doc:`plan-first orchestration <developer-guides/01_understanding-the-framework/04_orchestrator-first-philosophy>` with hardware-write detection, :doc:`protocol-agnostic integration with control stacks <developer-guides/05_production-systems/06_control-system-integration>` (EPICS, LabVIEW, Tango), and :doc:`mandatory human oversight for safety-critical operations <developer-guides/05_production-systems/01_human-approval-workflows>`.

Core Architecture
------------------

Osprey transforms control room operations through a control-aware architecture designed for safety-critical environments. The framework converts natural-language requests into transparent, executable plans through a four-stage pipeline—Task Extraction, Classification, Orchestration, and Execution—with comprehensive safety enforcement, checkpointing, and artifact tracking:

1. :doc:`Task Extraction <developer-guides/04_infrastructure-components/02_task-extraction-system>` → Convert conversational context into structured, actionable objectives

2. :doc:`Classification <developer-guides/04_infrastructure-components/03_classification-and-routing>` → Dynamically select relevant capabilities from your domain-specific toolkit

3. :doc:`Orchestration <developer-guides/04_infrastructure-components/04_orchestrator-planning>` → Generate complete execution plans with explicit dependencies and human oversight

4. **Execution** → Execute capabilities with checkpointing, artifact management, and safety controls

   **Production Deployment Example**: This diagram illustrates the framework architecture using capabilities from the :doc:`ALS Accelerator Assistant <example-applications/als-assistant>` - our production deployment at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Advanced Light Source particle accelerator.

The framework provides:

* **Plan-First Orchestration**: :doc:`Complete execution planning <developer-guides/04_infrastructure-components/04_orchestrator-planning>` with explicit dependencies before any hardware interaction, enabling operator review of all proposed control system operations
* **Control-System Awareness**: Pattern detection and static analysis identify hardware writes; :doc:`PV boundary checking <developer-guides/05_production-systems/06_control-system-integration>` validates setpoints against facility-defined limits before execution
* **Protocol-Agnostic Integration**: :doc:`Pluggable connectors <developer-guides/05_production-systems/06_control-system-integration>` for EPICS, LabVIEW, Tango, and mock environments enable development without hardware and seamless production migration through configuration
* **Scalable Capability Management**: :doc:`Dynamic classification <developer-guides/04_infrastructure-components/03_classification-and-routing>` selects relevant capabilities from large inventories, preventing prompt explosion as facilities expand toolsets
* **Secure Code Execution**: :doc:`Containerized Python generation and execution <developer-guides/05_production-systems/03_python-execution-service/index>` with read-only and write-enabled environments, static analysis, and mandatory approval for hardware-interacting scripts
* **Facility Data Integration**: :doc:`Automatic retrieval from archiver appliances, channel databases, and knowledge bases <developer-guides/05_production-systems/02_data-source-integration>` with intelligent downsampling for large time-series datasets
* **LangGraph Foundation**: Native StateGraph workflows with :doc:`checkpoints, interrupts <developer-guides/01_understanding-the-framework/03_langgraph-integration>`, and :doc:`persistent state management <developer-guides/03_core-framework-systems/01_state-management-architecture>`
* **Safety-First Design**: :ref:`Transparent execution plans <planning-mode-example>` with :doc:`human approval workflows <developer-guides/05_production-systems/01_human-approval-workflows>` and network-level isolation for control room deployment
* **Proven in Production**: Deployed at :doc:`Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Advanced Light Source <example-applications/als-assistant>` managing hundreds of thousands of control channels across accelerator operations
