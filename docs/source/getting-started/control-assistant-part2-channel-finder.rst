   For a comprehensive theoretical framework and analysis of semantic channel finding in complex experimental infrastructure, see Hellert et al. (2025), "From Natural Language to Control Signals: A Conceptual Framework for Semantic Channel Finding in Complex Experimental Infrastructure," available on `arXiv:2512.18779 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18779>`_.

**The Core Challenge: Bridging Human Language and Control System Addresses**

Control systems at scientific facilities present a fundamental communication gap: operators and physicists think in terms of physical concepts ("beam current," "terminal voltage," "ion pump pressure"), while control systems use technical addresses (``SR01C___DCCT1_AM00``, ``TMVST``, ``IP41Pressure``). This gap becomes critical in large facilities with thousands to hundreds of thousands of channels—manually looking up addresses is impractical, and exact string matching fails because users don't know the precise naming conventions.

**Semantic channel finding** solves this by using LLM-powered pipelines to translate natural language queries into specific control system addresses. Instead of requiring users to memorize technical names or browse through documentation, they can ask for what they need in their own words. The system understands the semantic meaning and finds the correct channels, even when query terminology doesn't exactly match the database.

**Why This Matters for Control Systems:**

- **Accessibility**: Non-experts can interact with complex systems without extensive training on naming conventions
- **Efficiency**: Eliminates time spent searching documentation or asking colleagues for channel names
- **Reliability**: Reduces errors from mistyped or misremembered addresses
- **Scalability**: Makes systems with thousands of channels as easy to use as small systems
- **Integration**: Enables natural language interfaces for automated procedures and diagnostics

---------

**Three Pipeline Implementations**

This template provides three semantic channel finding implementations, each suited to different facility architectures:

- **In-Context Search**: Direct semantic matching—best for small to medium systems (few hundred channels)
- **Hierarchical Navigation**: Structured navigation through system hierarchy—scales to large systems with strict naming patterns (thousands+ channels)
- **Middle Layer Exploration**: React agent with database query tools—scales to large systems organized by function rather than naming patterns (thousands+ channels)

All three pipelines share the same interface and capabilities, differing only in their matching strategy and database organization. Choose based on your system architecture, or try multiple and benchmark which performs better for your facility.

**Switching Between Pipelines**

To switch pipelines, edit ``config.yml`` and change the ``pipeline_mode`` setting:

.. code-block:: yaml

   channel_finder:
     pipeline_mode: in_context  # or "hierarchical" or "middle_layer"

That's it—no code changes required. The template includes complete implementations of all three pipelines with example databases, CLI tools, and benchmark datasets. The tabs below detail each pipeline's workflow, database format, and testing tools.

   **Not sure which pipeline to use?** Let a coding assistant help you choose based on your channel naming patterns.

   **When to use this workflow:**

   - Setting up Channel Finder for the first time
   - You have channel examples but aren't sure which pipeline fits best
   - You want to have a discussion with a coding assistant to help you choose the right pipeline

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: In-Context Pipeline

      **Concept:** Put the entire channel database in the LLM context and ask it to find matches.

      **Best for:** Small to medium systems (few hundred channels), facilities with flat channel lists, rapid prototyping when database structure is still evolving.

      **Pipeline Flow**:
         1. Query splitting
         2. Semantic matching against full database
         3. Validation/correction (iterative)


      .. dropdown:: Channel Names vs Addresses: Optimizing LLM Token Matching
         :color: info

         **The Challenge:** Control systems use cryptic addresses (``TMVST``, ``Acc_I``, ``IP41Pressure``), but users query with natural language ("terminal voltage setpoint", "grading resistor current"). The LLM needs to bridge this gap during semantic matching.

         **The Solution:** When building your channel database, you choose how to create the searchable channel names:

         .. code-block:: bash

            # Default: use raw addresses as channel names
            python build_channel_database.py

            # LLM-powered: generate descriptive channel names (recommended)
            python build_channel_database.py --use-llm --config config.yml

         **How It Works:**

         Your database stores three fields, but the LLM only sees two during semantic matching:

         +---------------------------------------+------------------+---------------+
         | ``channel`` (shown to LLM)            | ``address``      | ``description``|
         |                                       | (hidden from LLM)| (shown to LLM)|
         +=======================================+==================+===============+
         | Default: ``TMVST``                    | ``TMVST``        | "Set value... |
         +---------------------------------------+------------------+---------------+
         | With ``--use-llm``: ``TerminalVoltage | ``TMVST``        | "Set value... |
         | SetPoint``                            |                  |               |
         +---------------------------------------+------------------+---------------+

         The LLM sees only: ``channel`` + ``description`` (formatted as ``"ChannelName: Description"``)

         **Why Descriptive Names Dramatically Improve Matching:**

         When a user queries *"terminal voltage setpoint"*:

         - **Default mode** (``TMVST``): LLM matches on description alone → returns cryptic token ``TMVST``
         - **LLM-powered mode** (``TerminalVoltageSetPoint``): LLM matches on both name and description → returns semantically aligned token ``TerminalVoltageSetPoint``

         The descriptive channel name reinforces the semantic signal from the description, creating stronger, more consistent matches. The channel name becomes a searchable index aligned with how users think and query.

         **What the ``--use-llm`` flag does:**

         - Extracts semantic tokens from descriptions (location, device type, property)
         - Generates unique PascalCase names that align with description content
         - Preserves original addresses for control system connections

         Example results:

         +---------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
         | Channel (shown to LLM, searchable)    | Address (for EPICS/LabView/etc.)|
         +=======================================+=================================+
         | ``TerminalVoltageSetPoint``           | ``TMVST``                       |
         +---------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
         | ``AcceleratingTubeEndIonPumpPressure``| ``IP41Pressure``                |
         +---------------------------------------+---------------------------------+

         **Note:** You can manually edit channel names in the database JSON file at any time to customize them for your facility's terminology and conventions.

         :alt: In-Context Channel Finder CLI in action
         :align: center
         :width: 100%

         **Live Example**: In-context pipeline processing "What are the grading resistor currents and the terminal voltage?" — Shows query splitting into 2 atomic queries, full database mode with 255 channels, matching 4 results (2 grading resistor currents + 2 terminal voltages), and validation confirming all channels are valid.


      **Try It Now: Interactive Channel Finder**

      The template includes a working example database (UCSB FEL accelerator, 255 channels). Try the channel finder immediately—no database setup required:

      .. code-block:: bash

         # From my-control-assistant directory
         cd my-control-assistant

         # Switch to in-context pipeline
         # python config.yml: set pipeline_mode to "in_context"

         python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/cli.py

      **Example queries to try:**

      .. code-block:: text

         🔍 Query: What is the terminal voltage?
         🔍 Query: Get me the grading resistor currents and beam current

      **How It Works:**

      .. tab-set::

         .. tab-item:: Pipeline Stages

            The in-context pipeline uses a three-stage process to translate natural language into channel addresses.

            **Stage 1: Query Splitting**

            Complex queries are broken into atomic sub-queries to improve matching accuracy. For example, "grading resistor currents and terminal voltage" becomes two separate searches.

            The LLM analyzes the query structure and identifies distinct intents. Single-intent queries pass through unchanged, while multi-intent queries are split for independent processing.

            **Stage 2: Semantic Matching**

            Each atomic query is matched against the channel database using semantic similarity. The pipeline operates in two modes:

            - **Full database mode** (default, recommended for <200 channels): The entire database is presented to the LLM in a single context window. Fast and simple, but limited by model context size. Controlled by ``chunk_dictionary: false`` in ``config.yml``.

            - **Chunked mode** (for larger databases): The database is split into manageable chunks (default 50 channels per chunk, configurable via ``chunk_size`` in ``config.yml``), and each chunk is searched independently. Prevents context overflow but may miss cross-chunk relationships. Enable with ``chunk_dictionary: true``.

            The LLM receives the formatted database and atomic query, then identifies all matching channels based on semantic meaning rather than exact string matching. This allows queries like "beam current" to match channels with descriptions containing corresponding concepts.

            **Stage 3: Validation & Correction**

            All matched channels are validated against the database to ensure they actually exist. This catches hallucinations or malformed channel names.

            If invalid channels are detected, the pipeline enters a correction loop (maximum 2 iterations):

            1. The LLM is presented with the validation results (which channels are valid/invalid)
            2. It re-examines the database chunk with the original query
            3. It either corrects the invalid channels or removes them
            4. The corrected channels are re-validated

            Only validated channels appear in the final result. This ensures the assistant never provides non-existent channel addresses to users or downstream capabilities.

         .. tab-item:: Database Format

            **Simple Flat Structure - Plug and Play:**

            The in-context database uses a flat list where every channel has rich natural language descriptions for semantic matching:

            .. code-block:: json

               {
                 "channels": [
                   {
                     "template": false,
                     "channel": "TerminalVoltageReadBack",
                     "address": "TerminalVoltageReadBack",
                     "description": "Actual value of the terminal potential where electron gun and collector are located measured capacitively"
                   },
                   {
                     "template": false,
                     "channel": "AcceleratingTubeGradingResistorDiagnosticCurrent",
                     "address": "Acc_I",
                     "description": "Diagnostic current through grading resistor chain in accelerating tube"
                   },
                   {
                     "template": true,
                     "base_name": "BPM",
                     "instances": [1, 10],
                     "sub_channels": ["XPosition", "YPosition"],
                     "address_pattern": "BPM{instance:02d}{suffix}",
                     "description": "Beam Position Monitors measure electron beam location",
                     "channel_descriptions": {
                       "XPosition": "Horizontal position from BPM {instance:02d} in millimeters",
                       "YPosition": "Vertical position from BPM {instance:02d} in millimeters"
                     }
                   }
                 ]
               }

            **Key features:**

            - **Flat structure**: All channels at the same level, no nested hierarchy
            - **Rich descriptions**: Natural language descriptions enable semantic matching
            - **Template support**: Device families (like BPM01-BPM10) defined once and expanded automatically
            - **Separate naming**: ``channel`` (searchable name shown to LLM) vs. ``address`` (actual PV address, not shown to LLM)
            - **LLM sees**: Only ``channel`` + ``description`` during semantic matching

            **Minimal setup:** Just list your channels with descriptions. The pipeline handles the rest.

            **Workflow Overview:**

            .. code-block:: text

               CSV File              →  build_channel_database.py  →  Template JSON Database
               (raw data)               (with optional LLM naming)     (optimized format)
                                                ↓
                                        validate_database.py
                                        preview_database.py
                                        (verify structure & presentation)

            **Step 1: Prepare Your CSV File**

            For CSV format reference, see ``data/raw/CSV_EXAMPLE.csv`` which includes inline documentation of all supported patterns. The template also includes ``data/raw/address_list.csv`` with real UCSB FEL channel data (53 standalone channels + 5 device families = 255 total expanded channels).

            Create a CSV with your channel data (typically in ``src/my_control_assistant/data/raw/``) in this format:

            .. code-block:: csv

               address,description,family_name,instances,sub_channel
               TerminalVoltageReadBack,Actual value of terminal potential measured capacitively,,,
               Acc_I,Diagnostic current through grading resistor chain in accelerating tube (monitors voltage distribution health),,,
               DipoleMagnet{instance:02d}{sub_channel},Dipole magnets for beam bending - set point for magnet {instance},DipoleMagnet,9,SetPoint
               DipoleMagnet{instance:02d}{sub_channel},Dipole magnets for beam bending - readback for magnet {instance},DipoleMagnet,9,ReadBack
               SteeringCoil{instance:02d}{sub_channel},Steering coils for trajectory corrections - X direction setpoint,SteeringCoil,19,XSetPoint
               SteeringCoil{instance:02d}{sub_channel},Steering coils for trajectory corrections - X direction readback,SteeringCoil,19,XReadBack

            **Column Definitions:**

            - ``address``: The actual PV address or pattern (required)
            - ``description``: Natural language description for semantic matching (required)
            - ``family_name``: Device family identifier for template grouping (optional)
            - ``instances``: Number of device instances in the family (optional, for templates)
            - ``sub_channel``: Sub-channel type (e.g., SetPoint, ReadBack) (optional, for templates)

            **Template Detection Logic:**

            - Rows **with** ``family_name``: Grouped into template entries (efficient for device families)
            - Rows **without** ``family_name``: Standalone channel entries (one-off channels)

            **Step 2: Run the Database Builder**

            The builder tool processes your CSV and generates an optimized template-based database:

            .. code-block:: bash

               cd my-control-assistant

               # Basic build (uses addresses as channel names)
               python src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/build_channel_database.py

               # With LLM-generated descriptive names (recommended)
               python src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/build_channel_database.py --use-llm --config config.yml


            The template includes working UCSB FEL accelerator data by default:

            - **Format Reference:** ``data/raw/CSV_EXAMPLE.csv`` (documented examples of all patterns)
            - **Working Example:** ``data/raw/address_list.csv`` (real UCSB FEL channels)
            - **Default Output:** ``data/channel_databases/in_context.json`` (pre-built database)

            For your facility's data, specify custom paths:

            .. code-block:: bash

               python src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/build_channel_database.py \
                  --csv data/raw/your_address_list.csv \
                  --output data/channel_databases/your_database.json \
                  --use-llm --config config.yml

            **What the Builder Does:**

            1. **Loads CSV**: Reads your channel data, skipping comments and empty rows
            2. **Groups by Family**: Identifies device families from ``family_name`` column
            3. **Extracts Common Descriptions**: Automatically finds common description parts for template families
            4. **Creates Templates**: Builds template-based entries with instance ranges
            5. **Generates Names** (with ``--use-llm``): Creates descriptive PascalCase names for standalone channels
            6. **Resolves Duplicates**: Ensures all generated names are unique with location specificity
            7. **Adds Metadata**: Includes generation date, stats, and tool provenance

            **LLM Name Generation Example:**

            The database stores three fields per channel, but the in-context pipeline only presents ``channel`` and ``description`` to the LLM during semantic matching. The ``address`` is preserved for control system connections but never shown to the LLM.

            Without LLM (uses raw addresses):

            .. code-block:: json

               {
                 "channel": "Acc_I",
                 "address": "Acc_I",
                 "description": "Diagnostic current through grading resistor chain in accelerating tube"
               }

            LLM sees: ``"Acc_I: Diagnostic current through grading resistor chain in accelerating tube"``

            With LLM (descriptive, searchable names):

            .. code-block:: json

               {
                 "channel": "AcceleratingTubeGradingResistorDiagnosticCurrent",
                 "address": "Acc_I",
                 "description": "Diagnostic current through grading resistor chain in accelerating tube"
               }

            LLM sees: ``"AcceleratingTubeGradingResistorDiagnosticCurrent: Diagnostic current through grading resistor chain in accelerating tube"``

            The LLM uses facility-specific prompts to generate names that:

            - Use PascalCase format for consistency
            - Include location/position details (e.g., "AcceleratingTube", "Top", "Beginning")
            - Use full words instead of abbreviations (e.g., "SetPoint" not "Set")
            - Are unique across the entire database
            - Are self-documenting and semantic

            **Output Structure:**

            The builder creates a template-based JSON database with metadata:

            .. code-block:: json

               {
                 "_metadata": {
                   "generated_from": "data/raw/address_list.csv",
                   "generation_date": "2025-11-08",
                   "generator": "build_channel_database.py",
                   "llm_naming": {
                     "enabled": true,
                     "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku",
                     "purpose": "Generated descriptive PascalCase names for 53 standalone channels"
                   },
                   "stats": {
                     "template_entries": 5,
                     "standalone_entries": 53,
                     "total_entries": 58
                   }
                 },
                 "channels": [
                   { "template": false, "channel": "TerminalVoltageReadBack", ... },
                   { "template": true, "base_name": "DipoleMagnet", "instances": [1, 9], ... }
                 ]
               }

            **Step 3: Validate Your Database**

            Check for structural issues and verify the database can be loaded:

            .. code-block:: bash

               # From my-control-assistant directory
               python src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/validate_database.py

               # Validate specific file
               python src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/validate_database.py --database path/to/database.json

               # Show detailed statistics
               python src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/validate_database.py --verbose

            **Validation Checks:**

            - **Structure**: Valid JSON format, correct schema, required fields
            - **Templates**: Instance ranges ``[start, end]``, sub-channels, patterns
            - **Standalone**: All required fields (channel, address, description)
            - **Database Loading**: Can be loaded by ``TemplateChannelDatabase`` class
            - **Statistics**: Channel counts, compression ratio, entry types

            **Step 4: Preview Database Presentation**

            See exactly how the database will appear to the LLM:

            .. code-block:: bash

               # From my-control-assistant directory
               python src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/preview_database.py

               # Show all channels (not just first 20)
               python src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/preview_database.py --full

            This prints the database presentation directly to your terminal, showing:

            - Database configuration and statistics
            - First 20 channels in LLM presentation format (or all with ``--full``)
            - Template and standalone entry breakdown

            **Preview Output Example:**

            .. image:: ../_static/screenshots/channel_finder_db_preview_in_context.png
               :alt: In-Context Database Preview
               :align: center
               :width: 90%

            **Configuration:**

            The build tool uses command-line arguments to specify input/output paths. The LLM configuration for name generation can optionally be added to your ``config.yml``:

            .. code-block:: yaml

               channel_finder:
                 # LLM configuration for name generation (optional)
                 channel_name_generation:
                   llm_batch_size: 10
                   llm_model:
                     provider: cborg
                     model_id: anthropic/claude-haiku
                     max_tokens: 2000

            The database path is configured in the pipeline settings:

            .. code-block:: yaml

               channel_finder:
                 pipeline_mode: in_context  # Active pipeline: "in_context" or "hierarchical"

                 pipelines:
                   in_context:
                     database:
                       type: template
                       path: src/my_control_assistant/data/channel_databases/in_context.json
                       presentation_mode: template

            **Tool Locations:**

            All tools are in ``src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/`` and should be run from the ``my-control-assistant`` directory (for config.yml access):

            - ``build_channel_database.py``: Main builder (Workflow A: CSV → JSON)
            - ``validate_database.py``: Schema and loading validation
            - ``preview_database.py``: LLM presentation preview
            - ``llm_channel_namer.py``: LLM-based name generation library
            - ``README.md``: Comprehensive tool documentation

            **Alternative: Manual JSON Creation (Workflow B)**

            For complete control, you can create the JSON database manually:

            1. Create JSON file directly with template and standalone entries
            2. Run ``validate_database.py`` to check correctness
            3. Update ``config.yml`` with new database path
            4. Proceed to testing (next tab)

            Both workflows are supported and documented in the tools README.

         .. tab-item:: Test Your Database

            **Interactive Testing & Benchmarking**

            Once your database is built and validated, test its functionality with the CLI for rapid iteration, then benchmark it for statistical evaluation.

            **Interactive CLI: Rapid Development Testing**

            Query your database interactively without running the full agent:

            .. code-block:: bash

               # From my-control-assistant directory
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/cli.py

            This launches an interactive terminal where you can:

            - Test queries against your channel database in real-time
            - Watch the pipeline stages execute with live progress updates
            - Verify which channels are matched and why
            - Measure query execution time to optimize performance
            - Iterate on your database and see results immediately

            **Example queries to try:**

            - "What's the terminal voltage?"
            - "Show me all dipole magnets"
            - "Find steering coil setpoints"

            The CLI operates independently of the agent framework, making it ideal for rapid development cycles. You can quickly iterate on your channel descriptions and immediately test the results.

            **Benchmarking: Critical Validation Before Production**

            Benchmark datasets are **essential** for validating your channel finder before deployment. A benchmark that performs well during development with developer-created queries may completely fail in production when users with different mental models start querying the system.

            .. dropdown:: ⚠️ Critical Best Practice: Domain Expert Involvement
               :color: warning

               **DO NOT** rely solely on developer-created test queries. This is one of the most common failure modes in production systems:

               - **The Problem**: Developers unconsciously create queries that match their mental model of the system and the database structure they built
               - **The Result**: 95%+ accuracy in development, <60% accuracy in production when real users start querying
               - **The Solution**: Gather test queries from multiple domain experts and operators **before** finalizing your database

               **Why diverse queries matter:**

               - Different users have different mental models of the control system
               - Operators use different terminology than developers
               - Production queries often target edge cases not obvious to developers
               - Users query based on operational workflows, not database structure

               **Best practices for building benchmark datasets:**

               1. **Interview Domain Experts**: Talk to at least 3-5 different operators, physicists, or engineers who will use the system
               2. **Capture Real Workflows**: Ask them to describe their typical queries in their own words
               3. **Include Edge Cases**: Specifically ask about unusual or complex queries they might need
               4. **Diverse Terminology**: Look for variations in how different experts refer to the same equipment
               5. **Regular Updates**: Periodically add new queries from production usage to catch evolving patterns

            Once your database is ready and you have a diverse benchmark dataset from domain experts, run systematic benchmarks to measure accuracy:

            .. code-block:: bash

               # Run all benchmark queries
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py

               # Test specific queries (useful during development)
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py --queries 0,1

               # Compare model performance
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py --model anthropic/claude-sonnet

            **Benchmark Capabilities:**

            - **Statistical metrics**: Precision (accuracy of matches), recall (completeness), and F1 scores (harmonic mean)
            - **Success categorization**: Perfect matches (100% correct), partial matches (some correct), and failures
            - **Parallel execution**: Runs 5 queries concurrently by default to speed up large benchmark sets
            - **Incremental saves**: Results are saved after each query, so interruptions don't lose progress
            - **Consistency tracking**: Measures whether repeated queries produce the same results

            **Example benchmark results:**

            .. code-block:: text

            **Configuring Benchmarks:**

            The benchmark system is configured in ``config.yml`` with both global settings and pipeline-specific datasets:

            .. code-block:: yaml

               channel_finder:
                 # Active pipeline determines which benchmark dataset is used by default
                 pipeline_mode: in_context

                 pipelines:
                   in_context:
                     database:
                       type: template
                       path: src/my_control_assistant/data/channel_databases/in_context.json
                       presentation_mode: template

                     processing:
                       chunk_dictionary: false
                       chunk_size: 50
                       max_correction_iterations: 2

                  # Benchmark dataset for this pipeline
                  benchmark:
                    dataset_path: src/my_control_assistant/data/benchmarks/datasets/in_context_main.json
                    # In-context pipeline benchmark using UCSB FEL channels (30 queries)

               # Global benchmarking configuration
               benchmark:
                 # Execution settings
                 execution:
                   runs_per_query: 1                 # Number of times to run each query
                   delay_between_runs: 0             # Delay in seconds between runs
                   continue_on_error: true           # Continue even if some queries fail
                   max_concurrent_queries: 5         # Maximum parallel queries
                   query_selection: all              # "all" or specific queries like [0,1,2]

                 # Output settings
                 output:
                   results_dir: src/my_control_assistant/data/benchmarks/results
                   save_incremental: true            # Save results after each query
                   include_detailed_metrics: true    # Include detailed timing/cost metrics

                 # Evaluation thresholds
                 evaluation:
                   exact_match_weight: 1.0
                   partial_match_weight: 0.5

            You can override the dataset and other settings via CLI:

            .. code-block:: bash

               # Use a different dataset
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py \
                  --dataset src/my_control_assistant/data/benchmarks/datasets/custom_dataset.json

               # Run specific queries
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py --queries 0,1,5,10

               # Show detailed logs
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py --verbose

            **When to use these tools:**

            - **During development**: Use the CLI to rapidly test queries as you build your database
            - **Before deployment**: Run full benchmarks with domain expert queries to validate accuracy meets production requirements (aim for >90% F1 score)
            - **Model selection**: Compare different LLM models to balance cost, speed, and accuracy for your specific use case
            - **Continuous validation**: Re-run benchmarks after database updates to ensure no regression in accuracy

            **Best Practices:**

            1. **Rich Descriptions**: Write detailed, semantic descriptions for better LLM matching
            2. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent patterns within device families
            3. **Family Grouping**: Group related channels into templates for efficiency
            4. **LLM Naming**: Use ``--use-llm`` for standalone channels to get searchable names
            5. **Validate Early**: Run validation after building to catch structural issues
            6. **Preview Before Testing**: Check LLM presentation to ensure clarity
            7. **Iterate with CLI**: Test queries interactively before running full benchmarks
            8. **Benchmark Systematically**: Run full benchmark suite before production deployment


   .. tab-item:: Hierarchical Pipeline

      **Concept:** Navigate through a structured hierarchy of systems → families → devices → fields.

      **Best for:** Large systems (thousands+ channels), facilities with well-defined hierarchical organization, systems where context window size becomes a constraint.

      .. figure:: /_static/screenshots/channel_finder_hierachical_cli.png
         :alt: Hierarchical Channel Finder CLI in action
         :align: center
         :width: 100%

         **Live Example**: Hierarchical pipeline processing "whats the beam current?" through 5 navigation levels (system → family → device → field → subfield) to find ``DIAG:DCCT[MAIN]:CURRENT:RB`` from 1,050 channels. Shows the recursive branching at each level.


      **Try It Now: Interactive Channel Finder**

      The template includes a working example database (accelerator with magnets, vacuum, RF, and diagnostics—1,050 channels). Try the hierarchical channel finder immediately:

      .. code-block:: bash

         # From my-control-assistant directory
         cd my-control-assistant

         # Switch to hierarchical pipeline
         # Edit config.yml: set pipeline_mode to "hierarchical"

         python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/cli.py

      **Example queries to try:**

      .. code-block:: text

         🔍 Query: Whats the beam current?
         🔍 Query: Get me all focusing quadrupole currents

      .. admonition:: Database Format (v0.9.4+)
         :class: tip

         Hierarchical databases use a **flexible schema** that lets you define any hierarchy structure to match your control system. See the **Database Format** tab below for schema details and **Building Your Own Database** for a step-by-step guide.

      **How It Works:**

      .. tab-set::

         .. tab-item:: Pipeline Stages

            The hierarchical pipeline navigates through your control system's structure using a recursive multi-level approach.

            **Stage 1: Query Splitting**

            Identical to the in-context pipeline's query splitting stage, complex queries are decomposed into atomic sub-queries. Each atomic query then navigates the hierarchy independently.

            **Stage 2: Recursive Hierarchical Navigation**

            The pipeline navigates through five hierarchy levels in order: **system → family → device → field → subfield**. At each level, the LLM selects relevant options based on the query and previous selections.

            **Recursive branching** is the key feature that makes this scalable:

            - When multiple options are selected at **system**, **family**, or **field** levels, the pipeline branches into parallel exploration paths
            - Each branch continues navigating independently through the remaining levels
            - The **device** level is special: multiple devices don't cause branching because devices within a family are structurally identical

            **Example navigation flow:**

            Query: "What's the beam current?"

            1. **Level: system** → Available: [MAGNETS, VACUUM, RF, DIAGNOSTICS] → Selected: [DIAG]
            2. **Level: family** → Available: [DCCT, BPM, EMIT, TUNE] → Selected: [DCCT]
            3. **Level: device** → Available: [MAIN] → Selected: [MAIN]
            4. **Level: field** → Available: [CURRENT, STATUS] → Selected: [CURRENT]
            5. **Level: subfield** → Available: [SP, RB] → Selected: [RB]

            Result: ``DIAG:DCCT[MAIN]:CURRENT:RB``

            If the query had matched multiple families at level 2, the pipeline would branch—exploring each family path independently and combining all results.

            **Stage 3: Channel Assembly & Validation**

            Once navigation completes, the pipeline:

            1. Builds complete channel names from all navigation paths
            2. Validates each channel exists in the database
            3. Filters out any invalid channels (defensive check)
            4. Returns the validated channel list

            The hierarchical approach trades speed for scalability: navigation takes multiple LLM calls (one per level), but it can handle massive channel databases that wouldn't fit in any LLM context window.

         .. tab-item:: Database Format

            .. note::

               This tab shows the **simplest hierarchical database pattern**—a straightforward 5-level structure with basic naming. This is perfect for getting started.

               For **advanced patterns** (navigation-only levels, friendly names, optional levels, custom separators), see the **Building Your Database** tab which includes detailed examples and use cases for complex naming conventions.

            **Nested Hierarchy Structure:**

            The hierarchical database organizes channels by physical system structure with rich domain context at each level:

            .. code-block:: json

               {

            **Key features:**

            - **Clean schema**: Single ``hierarchy`` section combines level definitions and naming pattern with built-in validation
            - **Flexible structure**: Each level specifies its ``name`` and ``type`` (``tree`` for semantic categories, ``instances`` for numbered/patterned expansions)
            - **Deep descriptions**: Rich domain knowledge at every level guides LLM navigation
            - **Instance expansion**: Define device families once (e.g., QF01-QF16) using ``_expansion`` with ranges or lists
            - **Physical organization**: Hierarchy mirrors actual control system structure
            - **Automatic validation**: System ensures naming pattern references match level names, catching errors at load time

            .. dropdown:: Understanding Hierarchy Levels: Tree vs Instances
               :color: info

               Each level in the ``hierarchy.levels`` array specifies its behavior during navigation. Understanding the two level types is key to building effective hierarchical databases.

               **Tree Levels (``"type": "tree"``):**

               - **Purpose**: Navigate through named semantic categories
               - **Behavior**: LLM selects from explicitly defined options at this level; multiple selections trigger branching
               - **When to use**: For categorical decisions where each option has different meaning
               - **Examples**:
                  - Systems: MAG (magnets), VAC (vacuum), RF (radio frequency), DIAG (diagnostics)
                  - Families: DIPOLE, QUADRUPOLE, SEXTUPOLE, CORRECTOR
                  - Fields: CURRENT, STATUS, POSITION, VOLTAGE
                  - Subfields: SP (setpoint), RB (readback), GOLDEN (reference)

               **Instance Levels (``"type": "instances"``):**

               - **Purpose**: Expand across numbered or named instances that share the same structure
               - **Behavior**: Instances are generated from ``_expansion`` definition (range or list)
               - **When to use**: For device families where all instances have identical structure
               - **Examples**:
                  - Devices: QF01, QF02, ..., QF16 (all focusing quadrupoles with same fields)
                  - Numbered sensors: BPM01, BPM02, ..., BPM20 (all beam position monitors)
                  - Named instances: MAIN, BACKUP (both have same measurement structure)

               **Key Difference:**

               - **Tree**: Each option may have different children (MAG system has different families than VAC system)
               - **Expand Here**: All instances have identical children (QF01 has same fields as QF02, QF03, etc.)

               **Typical Pattern for Accelerators:**

               .. code-block:: text

                  system [tree] → family [tree] → device [expand_here] → field [tree] → subfield [tree]
                     ↓               ↓                ↓                     ↓                ↓
                  Navigate        Navigate         Expand all          Navigate         Navigate
                  (MAG/VAC/RF)    (QF/QD/DIPOLE)   (01-16)             (CURRENT/STATUS) (SP/RB)

               This pattern creates a powerful combination: semantic navigation through systems and families, automatic expansion across device instances, then semantic navigation through measurements.

            Result example: ``MAG:QF[QF03]:CURRENT:RB`` (Magnet system → QF family → device QF03 → CURRENT field → RB subfield)

            **Manual JSON Creation: A Structured Approach**

            Unlike the in-context pipeline (which has automated CSV-to-JSON builders), hierarchical databases require manual JSON creation. This reflects their purpose: representing well-organized control systems with existing hierarchical structures.

            .. dropdown:: AI-Assisted Database Building
               :color: info
               :icon: workflow

               **Need help structuring your hierarchy and writing descriptions?** Let an AI coding assistant guide you through the process.

               **When to use this workflow:**

               - Organizing your control system into a hierarchical structure
               - Writing distinguishing descriptions at branching points
               - Understanding which hierarchy levels need the most detailed descriptions
               - Extracting hierarchy information from existing documentation

               **Example query to your AI assistant:**

               .. code-block:: text

                  @osprey-workflows/channel-finder-database-builder.md Help me build my Channel Finder database.

                  I'm using the hierarchical pipeline for an accelerator with ~1,050 channels.
                  My naming follows SYSTEM:FAMILY[DEVICE]:FIELD:SUBFIELD pattern.
                  Guide me on writing descriptions that help the LLM navigate the hierarchy correctly.

               .. note::
                  First export workflows to your project: ``osprey workflows export``

               For more information about AI-assisted development workflows, see :doc:`../contributing/03_ai-assisted-development`.

            **When to Use This Workflow:**

            - Your control system has a clear hierarchical structure (systems → families → devices → fields)
            - You have > 1,000 channels (hierarchical scales better than in-context)
            - Your naming convention already follows a pattern (e.g., ``SYSTEM:FAMILY[DEVICE]:FIELD:SUBFIELD``)
            - You value auditability and transparent navigation logic

            **Step 1: Understand the Schema**

            The hierarchical database format in OSPREY uses a clean, flexible schema with two top-level keys:

            .. code-block:: json

               {
                 "hierarchy": {
                   "levels": [
                     {"name": "system", "type": "tree"},
                     {"name": "family", "type": "tree"},
                     {"name": "device", "type": "instances"},
                     {"name": "field", "type": "tree"},
                     {"name": "subfield", "type": "tree"}
                   ],
                   "naming_pattern": "{system}:{family}[{device}]:{field}:{subfield}"
                 },
                 "tree": { /* nested structure */ }
               }

            **hierarchy**: Configuration combining level definitions and naming pattern. This section includes:

            - **levels**: Ordered array defining each hierarchy level. Each level specifies:

              - ``name``: Level identifier used in navigation and naming pattern
              - ``type``: Either ``"tree"`` (navigate through named semantic categories like MAG, VAC, RF) or ``"instances"`` (expand numbered/patterned instances like QF01, QF02 that share the same structure)

              Define as many or as few levels as your system needs—three levels for simple systems, five for typical accelerators, ten or more for complex facilities.

            - **naming_pattern**: Template for assembling complete channel names from navigation selections. Uses Python format string syntax with level names as placeholders (e.g., ``{system}:{device}:{field}``). All placeholders must reference defined level names.

            .. dropdown:: Advanced Hierarchy Patterns (v0.9.6+)
               :color: info
               :icon: versions

               Three advanced features enable flexible hierarchical organization for diverse control system naming conventions:

               .. tab-set::

                  .. tab-item:: Navigation-Only Levels

                     **Use Case**: Provide semantic navigation context without cluttering channel names. Perfect when your PV names are self-contained but benefit from hierarchical browsing.

                     **How It Works**: Not all hierarchy levels need to appear in the naming pattern. Omit levels from ``naming_pattern`` to use them for navigation only.

                     **Example** (JLab CEBAF pattern):

                     .. code-block:: json

                        {
                          "hierarchy": {
                            "levels": [
                              {"name": "system", "type": "tree"},      // Navigation only
                              {"name": "family", "type": "tree"},      // Navigation only
                              {"name": "location", "type": "tree"},    // Navigation only
                              {"name": "pv", "type": "tree"}           // Used in pattern ✓
                            ],
                            "naming_pattern": "{pv}"
                          },
                          "tree": {
                            "Magnets": {
                              "Skew Quads": {
                                "North Linac": {
                                  "MQS1L02.S": {"_description": "Current Setpoint"},
                                  "MQS1L02M": {"_description": "Current Readback"}
                                }
                              }
                            }
                          }
                        }

                     **Navigation Path**: ``Magnets → Skew Quads → North Linac → MQS1L02.S``

                     **Generated Channel**: ``MQS1L02.S``

                     **Benefits**:

                     - Clean semantic navigation through system hierarchy
                     - Channel names stay concise (just the PV string)
                     - Backward compatible with existing PV naming schemes
                     - LLM gets rich context from navigation levels for better matching

                     **Example Database**: ``hierarchical_jlab_style.json``

                  .. tab-item:: Friendly Names

                     **Use Case**: Use human-readable names for navigation while preserving technical naming conventions in channel names. Separate "what operators call it" from "what the control system needs".

                     **How It Works**: Add ``_channel_part`` field to tree nodes to decouple the tree key (navigation) from the naming component (channel name).

                     **Example**:

                     .. code-block:: json

                        {
                          "hierarchy": {
                            "levels": [
                              {"name": "system", "type": "tree"},
                              {"name": "device", "type": "tree"}
                            ],
                            "naming_pattern": "{system}:{device}"
                          },
                          "tree": {
                            "Magnets": {
                              "_channel_part": "MAG",
                              "_description": "Magnet control system",
                              "Skew Quadrupoles": {
                                "_channel_part": "SK",
                                "_description": "Skew quadrupole family"
                              }
                            }
                          }
                        }

                     **Navigation Path**: ``Magnets → Skew Quadrupoles``

                     **Generated Channel**: ``MAG:SK``

                     **Key Features**:

                     - ``_channel_part`` defaults to tree key (backward compatible)
                     - Empty string ``_channel_part: ""`` creates navigation-only nodes
                     - Mix and match: some levels with ``_channel_part``, some without
                     - Works with instance expansion (``_expansion``)

                     **Benefits**:

                     - Operators navigate using familiar terminology
                     - Channel names use facility-specific technical codes
                     - Easier onboarding for new operators (friendly names in navigation)
                     - Maintains compatibility with existing control systems

                     **Example Database**: ``hierarchical_jlab_style.json``

                  .. tab-item:: Optional Levels

                     **Use Case**: Generate both base channels AND variants with additional suffixes/subdevices. Common for signals that have setpoint/readback pairs or channels that optionally include intermediate levels.

                     **How It Works**: Mark levels as ``"optional": true`` in hierarchy definition. Nodes without children are automatically detected as leaves. Use ``_is_leaf: true`` ONLY on nodes that have children but are also complete channels themselves.

                     **Example** (Signal with optional suffix):

                     .. code-block:: json

                        {
                          "hierarchy": {
                            "levels": [
                              {"name": "system", "type": "tree"},
                              {"name": "device", "type": "instances"},
                              {"name": "signal", "type": "tree"},
                              {"name": "suffix", "type": "tree", "optional": true}
                            ],
                            "naming_pattern": "{system}-{device}:{signal}_{suffix}"
                          },
                          "tree": {
                            "SYSTEM": {
                              "DEVICE": {
                                "_expansion": {
                                  "_type": "range",
                                  "_pattern": "DEV-{:02d}",
                                  "_range": [1, 10]
                                },
                                "SIGNAL-Y": {
                                  "_is_leaf": true,
                                  "_description": "Base signal - also has RB/SP variants (explicit _is_leaf needed)",
                                  "RB": {
                                    "_description": "Readback variant (already a leaf - no _is_leaf needed)"
                                  },
                                  "SP": {
                                    "_description": "Setpoint variant (already a leaf - no _is_leaf needed)"
                                  }
                                }
                              }
                            }
                          }
                        }

                     **Generated Channels**:

                     - ``SYSTEM-DEV-01:SIGNAL-Y`` (base, skips optional suffix)
                     - ``SYSTEM-DEV-01:SIGNAL-Y_RB`` (with RB suffix)
                     - ``SYSTEM-DEV-01:SIGNAL-Y_SP`` (with SP suffix)

                     **Key Features**:

                     - ``_is_leaf: true`` marks a node as a complete channel
                     - Leaf nodes can still have children (for optional levels)
                     - Automatic separator cleanup (removes ``::`` and trailing ``_``)
                     - Multiple optional levels can be chained

                     **Benefits**:

                     - Single definition generates both base and variant channels
                     - Handles complex naming conventions (e.g., with/without subdevices)
                     - Explicit leaf marking makes intent clear
                     - Supports gradual migration (some devices with sublevels, some without)

                     **Example Database**: ``optional_levels.json`` (82 channels demonstrating optional levels and separator overrides)

                  .. tab-item:: Custom Separators

                     **Use Case**: Override default separators for specific nodes to match existing EPICS naming conventions that use different delimiters in different contexts.

                     **How It Works**: Add ``_separator`` metadata to any tree node to customize the separator before its children, overriding the default from the naming pattern.

                     **Simple Example**:

                     Your naming pattern uses colons everywhere:

                     .. code-block:: json

                        {
                          "hierarchy": {
                            "naming_pattern": "{system}:{device}:{signal}:{suffix}"
                          }
                        }

                     Default behavior (all colons):

                     .. code-block:: text

                        CTRL:DEV-01:Mode:RB       (colon before RB)
                        CTRL:DEV-01:MOTOR:Position (colon before Position)

                     But your facility's actual PV convention uses:

                     - Underscore (``_``) for record field suffixes (RB, SP, CMD)
                     - Dot (``.``) for motor subsystem navigation

                     **Solution - Add separator overrides**:

                     .. code-block:: json

                        {
                          "tree": {
                            "CTRL": {
                              "DEVICE": {
                                "_expansion": {"_instances": ["DEV-01", "DEV-02"]},

                                "Mode": {
                                  "_separator": "_",
                                  "_is_leaf": true,
                                  "_description": "Operating mode",
                                  "RB": {"_description": "Readback"},
                                  "SP": {"_description": "Setpoint"}
                                },

                                "MOTOR": {
                                  "_separator": ".",
                                  "_description": "Motor subsystem",
                                  "Position": {"_description": "Position"},
                                  "Velocity": {"_description": "Velocity"}
                                }
                              }
                            }
                          }
                        }

                     **Result - Matches your convention**:

                     .. code-block:: text

                        CTRL:DEV-01:Mode_RB        (underscore from _separator)
                        CTRL:DEV-01:Mode_SP        (underscore from _separator)
                        CTRL:DEV-01:MOTOR.Position (dot from _separator)
                        CTRL:DEV-01:MOTOR.Velocity (dot from _separator)

                     **Why This Matters**:

                     Many EPICS facilities have evolved naming conventions where:

                     - Historical subsystems use dots: ``OLD:MOTOR.Speed``
                     - Modern subsystems use colons: ``NEW:MOTOR:Speed``
                     - Record fields always use underscores: ``DEV:Signal_RB``

                     Without separator overrides, you'd need separate databases or complex restructuring. With overrides, each node declares its own separator independently.

                     **Multiple Overrides in One Path**:

                     Different nodes can override independently:

                     .. code-block:: json

                        "LEGACY": {
                          "_separator": ".",
                          "CTRL": {
                            "_separator": "-",
                            "Mode": {
                              "_separator": "_",
                              "RB": {...}
                            }
                          }
                        }

                     Generates: ``CTRL:LEGACY.CTRL-Mode_RB`` (colon, then dot, then dash, then underscore)

                     **Key Features**:

                     - Override works at **any** hierarchy level
                     - Each node's ``_separator`` only affects its **immediate children**
                     - Backward compatible (no ``_separator`` = use pattern default)
                     - Combines with optional levels seamlessly

                     **Common EPICS Patterns**:

                     .. code-block:: json

                        "Signal": {
                          "_separator": "_",
                          "RB": {...},   // Signal_RB
                          "SP": {...}    // Signal_SP
                        }

                     .. code-block:: json

                        "LegacyMotor": {
                          "_separator": ".",
                          "Speed": {...},     // LegacyMotor.Speed
                          "Position": {...}   // LegacyMotor.Position
                        }

                     **Example Database**: ``optional_levels.json`` (shows separator overrides with optional levels)

            **tree**: The nested hierarchy structure with descriptions at every level (details below).

            **Step 2: Build Your Hierarchy Tree**

            The tree follows a nested structure where each level contains:

            .. tab-set::

               .. tab-item:: System

                  Top-level systems with ``_description`` fields:

                  .. code-block:: json

                     "tree": {
                       "MAG": {
                         "_description": "Magnet System (MAG): Controls beam trajectory and focusing...",
                         /* families go here */
                       },
                       "VAC": {
                         "_description": "Vacuum System (VAC): Maintains ultra-high vacuum...",
                         /* families go here */
                       }
                     }

               .. tab-item:: Family

                  Device families within each system:

                  .. code-block:: json

                     "QF": {
                       "_description": "Focusing Quadrupoles (QF): Positive gradient magnets...",
                       "DEVICE": {
                         "_expansion": { /* expansion definition */ },
                         /* fields go here as direct children */
                       }
                     }

               .. tab-item:: Device

                  Container with ``_expansion`` definition specifying instances:

                  .. code-block:: json

                     "DEVICE": {
                       "_expansion": {
                         "_type": "range",
                         "_pattern": "QF{:02d}",
                         "_range": [1, 16]
                       },
                       /* fields defined here */
                     }

                  This generates QF01, QF02, ..., QF16 automatically. For explicit lists:

                  .. code-block:: json

                     "DEVICE": {
                       "_expansion": {
                         "_type": "list",
                         "_instances": ["MAIN", "BACKUP"]
                       },
                       /* fields defined here */
                     }

               .. tab-item:: Field

                  Physical quantities or subsystems (as direct children of DEVICE):

                  .. code-block:: json

                     "DEVICE": {
                       "_expansion": { /* ... */ },
                       "CURRENT": {
                         "_description": "Excitation Current (Amperes): Current through coil windings...",
                         "SP": {"_description": "Setpoint (read-write): Commanded current"},
                         "RB": {"_description": "Readback (read-only): Measured current"}
                       },
                       "STATUS": {
                         "_description": "Operational status indicators",
                         "READY": {"_description": "Ready (read-only): Power supply ready"},
                         "ON": {"_description": "On (read-only): Power supply energized"}
                       }
                     }

               .. tab-item:: Subfield

                  Specific measurements or control points (as direct children of each field):

                  .. code-block:: json

                     "CURRENT": {
                       "_description": "Excitation Current (Amperes)...",
                       "SP": {"_description": "Setpoint (read-write): Commanded current"},
                       "RB": {"_description": "Readback (read-only): Measured current"},
                       "GOLDEN": {"_description": "Golden reference value for optimal operation"}
                     }

            **Step 3: Write Rich Descriptions**

            Descriptions are critical for LLM navigation. Good descriptions include:

            1. **Full name expansion**: "QF" → "Focusing Quadrupoles (QF)"
            2. **Physical function**: "Focus horizontal, defocus vertical"
            3. **Domain context**: "Part of tune correction system"
            4. **Units and ranges**: "(Amperes)", "Typically 0-200A"
            5. **Access mode**: "(read-write)" or "(read-only)"

            .. dropdown:: Example of excellent description depth
               :color: info

               .. code-block:: json

                  "DEVICE": {
                    "_expansion": {
                      "_type": "range",
                      "_pattern": "QF{:02d}",
                      "_range": [1, 16]
                    },
                    "CURRENT": {
                      "_description": "Quadrupole Excitation Current (Amperes): Current through QF coil windings. Proportional to positive field gradient. Typically 0-200A. Adjusted for tune correction and beam optics optimization.",
                      "SP": {
                        "_description": "Setpoint (read-write): Commanded focusing current for tune correction."
                      },
                      "RB": {
                        "_description": "Readback (read-only): Measured focusing current from DCCT sensor."
                      }
                    }
                  }

               The more context you provide, the better the LLM can match user queries to the correct path.

            **Step 4: Validate Your Database**

            The validation tool auto-detects your pipeline type and validates accordingly:

            .. code-block:: bash

               # From my-control-assistant directory
               python src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/validate_database.py

               # Or validate a specific file
               python src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/validate_database.py --database path/to/hierarchical.json

            For hierarchical databases, validation checks:

            - **JSON Structure**: Valid syntax, required top-level keys (hierarchy, tree)
            - **Schema Validation**: Naming pattern references exactly match level names (prevents typos and out-of-sync errors)
            - **Level Configuration**: All levels have valid types (tree or instances), properly configured
            - **Hierarchy Consistency**: All levels properly nested, instance expansion definitions valid
            - **Database Loading**: Can be successfully loaded by ``HierarchicalChannelDatabase`` class
            - **Channel Expansion**: Tree structure expands correctly to generate channel names

            If you encounter issues, the validator will report specific problems with line numbers or key paths to help you debug.

            **Step 5: Preview Database Presentation**

            See how your hierarchical database will be presented to the LLM during navigation:

            .. code-block:: bash

               # From my-control-assistant directory
               # Quick overview (default: 3 levels, 10 items per level)
               python src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/preview_database.py

               # Show 4 levels with statistics
               python src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/preview_database.py --depth 4 --sections tree,stats

               # Complete view with all sections
               python src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/preview_database.py --depth -1 --max-items -1 --sections all

               # Focus on specific subsystem
               python src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/preview_database.py --focus M:QB --depth 4

            .. dropdown:: Preview Tool Parameters (v0.9.6+)
               :color: info
               :icon: versions

               The preview tool supports flexible display options for exploring large hierarchical databases without overwhelming your terminal.

               **Display Control:**

               - ``--depth N``: Maximum hierarchy depth to display (default: 3, use -1 for unlimited)
               - ``--max-items N``: Maximum items to show per level (default: 10, use -1 for unlimited)
               - ``--full``: Legacy flag, equivalent to ``--depth -1 --max-items -1``

               **Section Selection:**

               - ``--sections SECTIONS``: Comma-separated list of sections to display (default: tree)

                 - ``tree``: Visual hierarchy tree with channel counts
                 - ``stats``: Per-level unique value statistics
                 - ``breakdown``: Channel count breakdown by path
                 - ``samples``: Random sample channel names
                 - ``all``: All of the above

               **Focus & Filtering:**

               - ``--focus PATH``: Zoom into specific subtree using colon-separated path (e.g., ``M:QB`` shows only QB family in M system)
               - ``--path FILE``: Preview a specific database file, auto-detects type (overrides config)

               **Example Workflows:**

               .. code-block:: bash

                  # Quick check of overall structure
                  python preview_database.py --sections stats

                  # Deep dive into magnet quadrupoles
                  python preview_database.py --focus M:QF --depth 5 --max-items 15

                  # Compare database files
                  python preview_database.py --path examples/consecutive_instances.json --depth -1
                  python preview_database.py --path examples/optional_levels.json --depth -1

                  # Full analysis with all metrics
                  python preview_database.py --depth -1 --max-items -1 --sections all

               **Why These Parameters Matter:**

               For large databases (1000+ channels), viewing the complete hierarchy can overwhelm your terminal. The preview tool helps you explore incrementally:

               - Start with ``--depth 3`` to understand top-level structure
               - Use ``--focus`` to zoom into specific subsystems
               - Add ``--sections stats`` to see level distribution
               - Finally use ``--depth -1 --max-items -1`` for complete view

            **Best Practices:**

            1. **Mirror Physical Structure**: Organize the hierarchy to match your actual control system architecture
            2. **Consistent Naming**: Use the same naming conventions throughout (e.g., always use "Setpoint" not "Set" or "SP")
            3. **Rich Context**: Write descriptions as if explaining to a new operator - assume no prior knowledge
            4. **Device Patterns**: Use range notation for device families (more compact than explicit lists)
            5. **Domain Vocabulary**: Include common synonyms in descriptions (e.g., "current" and "amperes")
            6. **Test Incrementally**: Build one system at a time, test it, then add the next
            7. **Validate Early**: Run validation after each system to catch issues before they compound

            **Interactive Testing & Benchmarking**

            Once your database is built and validated, test its functionality with the CLI for rapid iteration, then benchmark it for statistical evaluation.

            **Interactive CLI: Rapid Development Testing**

            Query your database interactively without running the full agent:

            .. code-block:: bash

               # From my-control-assistant directory
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/cli.py

            This launches an interactive terminal where you can:

            - Test queries against your channel database in real-time
            - Watch the pipeline stages execute with live progress updates
            - Verify which channels are matched and why
            - Measure query execution time to optimize performance
            - Iterate on your database and see results immediately

            **Example queries to try:**

            - **Single channel**: "What's the beam current?" → ``DIAG:DCCT[MAIN]:CURRENT:RB``
            - **Device range**: "All focusing quadrupoles" → 48 channels (QF01-QF16 × 3 subfields)
            - **Field wildcards**: "Vacuum pressure in sector 1" → ``VAC:ION-PUMP[SR01]:PRESSURE:RB``
            - **Multi-level branching**: "RF cavity voltage" → 6 channels (C1+C2 × 3 subfields)

            The CLI shows navigation decisions at each level, making it easy to spot issues with descriptions or hierarchy structure.

            **Benchmarking: Critical Validation Before Production**

            Benchmark datasets are **essential** for validating your channel finder before deployment. A benchmark that performs well during development with developer-created queries may completely fail in production when users with different mental models start querying the system.

            .. dropdown:: ⚠️ Critical Best Practice: Domain Expert Involvement
               :color: warning

               **DO NOT** rely solely on developer-created test queries. This is one of the most common failure modes in production systems:

               - **The Problem**: Developers unconsciously create queries that match their mental model of the system and the database structure they built
               - **The Result**: 95%+ accuracy in development, <60% accuracy in production when real users start querying
               - **The Solution**: Gather test queries from multiple domain experts and operators **before** finalizing your database

               **Why diverse queries matter:**

               - Different users have different mental models of the control system
               - Operators use different terminology than developers
               - Production queries often target edge cases not obvious to developers
               - Users query based on operational workflows, not database structure

               **Best practices for building benchmark datasets:**

               1. **Interview Domain Experts**: Talk to at least 3-5 different operators, physicists, or engineers who will use the system
               2. **Capture Real Workflows**: Ask them to describe their typical queries in their own words
               3. **Include Edge Cases**: Specifically ask about unusual or complex queries they might need
               4. **Diverse Terminology**: Look for variations in how different experts refer to the same equipment
               5. **Regular Updates**: Periodically add new queries from production usage to catch evolving patterns

            Once your database is ready and you have a diverse benchmark dataset from domain experts, run systematic benchmarks to measure accuracy:

            .. code-block:: bash

               # Run all benchmark queries
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py

               # Test specific queries (useful during development)
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py --queries 0,1

               # Compare model performance
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py --model anthropic/claude-sonnet

            **Benchmark Capabilities:**

            - **Statistical metrics**: Precision (accuracy of matches), recall (completeness), and F1 scores (harmonic mean)
            - **Success categorization**: Perfect matches (100% correct), partial matches (some correct), and failures
            - **Parallel execution**: Runs 5 queries concurrently by default to speed up large benchmark sets
            - **Incremental saves**: Results are saved after each query, so interruptions don't lose progress
            - **Consistency tracking**: Measures whether repeated queries produce the same results

            **Example benchmark results:**

            .. code-block:: text

            **Configuring Benchmarks:**

            The benchmark system is configured in ``config.yml`` with both global settings and pipeline-specific datasets:

            .. code-block:: yaml

               channel_finder:
                 # Active pipeline determines which benchmark dataset is used by default
                 pipeline_mode: hierarchical

                 pipelines:
                   hierarchical:
                     database:
                       type: hierarchical
                       path: src/my_control_assistant/data/channel_databases/hierarchical.json

                  # Benchmark dataset for this pipeline
                  benchmark:
                    dataset_path: src/my_control_assistant/data/benchmarks/datasets/hierarchical_benchmark.json
                    # Hierarchical pipeline benchmark with multi-level channel structure (47 queries)

               # Global benchmarking configuration
               benchmark:
                 # Execution settings
                 execution:
                   runs_per_query: 1                 # Number of times to run each query
                   delay_between_runs: 0             # Delay in seconds between runs
                   continue_on_error: true           # Continue even if some queries fail
                   max_concurrent_queries: 5         # Maximum parallel queries
                   query_selection: all              # "all" or specific queries like [0,1,2]

                 # Output settings
                 output:
                   results_dir: src/my_control_assistant/data/benchmarks/results
                   save_incremental: true            # Save results after each query
                   include_detailed_metrics: true    # Include detailed timing/cost metrics

                 # Evaluation thresholds
                 evaluation:
                   exact_match_weight: 1.0
                   partial_match_weight: 0.5

            You can override the dataset and other settings via CLI:

            .. code-block:: bash

               # Use a different dataset
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py \
                  --dataset src/my_control_assistant/data/benchmarks/datasets/custom_dataset.json

               # Run specific queries
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py --queries 0,1,5,10

               # Show detailed logs
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py --verbose

            **When to use these tools:**

            - **During development**: Use the CLI to rapidly test queries as you build your database
            - **Before deployment**: Run full benchmarks with domain expert queries to validate accuracy meets production requirements (aim for >90% F1 score)
            - **Model selection**: Compare different LLM models to balance cost, speed, and accuracy for your specific use case
            - **Continuous validation**: Re-run benchmarks after database updates to ensure no regression in accuracy

            **Best Practices:**

            1. **Rich Descriptions**: Write detailed, domain-specific descriptions at every hierarchy level
            2. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent patterns throughout the hierarchy
            3. **Iterative Testing**: Test incrementally as you build each system
            4. **Domain Expert Queries**: Gather test queries from multiple operators and experts
            5. **Regular Benchmarking**: Re-run benchmarks after database changes to catch regressions
            6. **CLI First**: Use interactive CLI for rapid iteration before running full benchmarks
            7. **Document Patterns**: Keep notes on navigation patterns that work well for your facility

   .. tab-item:: Middle Layer Pipeline

      **Concept:** Agent explores database using query tools to find channels by function.

      **Best for:** Large systems organized by function (Monitor, Setpoint) rather than naming patterns, facilities using MATLAB Middle Layer (MML) style organization, systems requiring device/sector filtering.

      .. figure:: /_static/screenshots/channel_finder_middlelayer_cli.png
         :alt: Middle Layer Channel Finder CLI in action
         :align: center
         :width: 100%

         **Live Example**: Middle layer pipeline processing "What's the beam current?" using React agent with database query tools. Shows the agent calling list_systems(), list_families(), inspect_fields(), and list_channel_names() to explore the functional hierarchy (SR → DCCT → Monitor) and find ``SR:DCCT:Current``.


      **Try It Now: Interactive Channel Finder**

      The template includes a working example database (accelerator with Storage Ring, Booster, and Transfer Line).

      .. code-block:: bash

         # From my-control-assistant directory
         cd my-control-assistant

         # Switch to middle_layer pipeline
         # Edit config.yml: set pipeline_mode to "middle_layer"

         python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/cli.py

      **Example queries to try:**

      .. code-block:: text

         🔍 Query: What's the beam current?
         🔍 Query: Get me BPM X positions in sector 1

      **How It Works:**

      .. tab-set::

         .. tab-item:: Pipeline Stages

            The middle layer pipeline uses a React agent with database query tools to find channels through functional exploration.

            **Stage 1: Query Splitting**

            Identical to the other pipelines' query splitting stage, complex queries are decomposed into atomic sub-queries. Each atomic query then explores the database independently using the agent.

            **Stage 2: Agent-Based Database Exploration**

            The pipeline uses a LangGraph React agent with five database query tools. The agent autonomously explores the functional hierarchy (System → Family → Field → Subfield) to find matching channels.

            **Available Tools:**

            1. **list_systems()** - Get all available systems with descriptions
            2. **list_families(system)** - Get device families within a system
            3. **inspect_fields(system, family, field)** - Examine field structure and subfields
            4. **list_channel_names(...)** - Retrieve actual PV addresses with optional filtering
            5. **get_common_names(system, family)** - Get friendly device names

            The agent follows this typical workflow:

            Query: "What's the beam current?"

            1. **Explore systems** → Calls ``list_systems()`` → Finds SR, VAC, BR, BTS
            2. **Select relevant system** → Chooses SR (Storage Ring) based on description
            3. **Explore families** → Calls ``list_families('SR')`` → Finds BPM, HCM, DCCT, etc.
            4. **Identify beam current family** → Chooses DCCT (DC Current Transformer)
            5. **Inspect fields** → Calls ``inspect_fields('SR', 'DCCT')`` → Finds Monitor, FastMonitor, Lifetime
            6. **Retrieve channels** → Calls ``list_channel_names('SR', 'DCCT', 'Monitor')``
            7. **Report results** → Returns ``SR:DCCT:Current``

            **Key Features:**

            - **Autonomous exploration**: Agent decides which tools to call and in what order
            - **Description-aware**: Uses optional ``_description`` fields when available for better matching
            - **Subfield navigation**: Automatically discovers nested structures (e.g., X/Y under BPM)
            - **Device filtering**: Supports optional sector/device filtering when ``DeviceList`` metadata present

            **Stage 3: Result Aggregation & Deduplication**

            Results from all atomic queries are combined and deduplicated to provide a clean final result.

         .. tab-item:: Database Format

            **Functional Hierarchy Structure:**

               **Need help organizing functional hierarchy and writing descriptions?** Let an AI coding assistant guide you through the process.

               **When to use this workflow:**

               - Organizing channels by function (System → Family → Field)
               - Writing descriptions that help the agent explore the database
               - Converting from MATLAB Middle Layer or other middle layer formats
               - Understanding what metadata to include for effective matching

               **Example query to your AI assistant:**

               .. code-block:: text

                  @osprey-workflows/channel-finder-database-builder.md Help me build my Channel Finder database.

                  I'm using the middle layer pipeline for an accelerator with functional organization.
                  I have MATLAB Middle Layer exports and want to ensure rich descriptions at all levels.
                  Guide me on writing descriptions that help the agent explore the database effectively.

               For more information about AI-assisted development workflows, see :doc:`../contributing/03_ai-assisted-development`.

            **Workflow Overview:**

            .. code-block:: text

               MML Python Export  →  mml_converter.py  →  Middle Layer JSON Database
               (MML_ao_SR.py)        (conversion tool)     (optimized format)
                                           ↓
                                   validate_database.py
                                   preview_database.py
                                   (verify structure & presentation)

            **Step 1: Export Your MML Data**

            If you have MATLAB Middle Layer data, export the ``ao`` (accelerator object) structure to Python format. The structure typically contains system/family hierarchies with channel information.

            **Step 2: Use the MML Converter**

            The template includes a conversion utility that transforms MML Python exports into middle layer JSON format:

            .. code-block:: bash

               cd my-control-assistant

               # Convert MML exports to JSON
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/utils/mml_converter.py \
                  --input path/to/mml_exports.py \
                  --output src/my_control_assistant/data/channel_databases/middle_layer.json

            **Using the Converter Programmatically:**

            .. code-block:: python

               from mml_converter import MMLConverter

               # Import your MML exports
               from my_facility_mml import MML_ao_SR, MML_ao_BR, MML_ao_VAC

               # Create converter and add systems
               converter = MMLConverter()
               converter.add_system("SR", MML_ao_SR)
               converter.add_system("BR", MML_ao_BR)
               converter.add_system("VAC", MML_ao_VAC)

               # Save to JSON
               converter.save_json("my_facility.json")

            **What the Converter Does:**

            1. **Extracts hierarchy**: Preserves System → Family → Field → ChannelNames structure
            2. **Preserves metadata**: Keeps DataType, Mode, Units, HWUnits, PhysicsUnits, MemberOf
            3. **Handles subfields**: Detects nested field structures automatically
            4. **Includes setup data**: Transfers CommonNames and DeviceList for filtering
            5. **Validates structure**: Ensures all required fields present
            6. **Reports statistics**: Shows channel counts and organization

            .. admonition:: Collaboration Welcome
               :class: outreach

               The MML converter was developed and tested with the Advanced Light Source (ALS) MATLAB Middle Layer format. If your facility uses MATLAB Middle Layer or another middle layer solution with a different structure or export format, we'd love to add native support for it! Please open an issue on GitHub describing your middle layer system and we can work together to implement a converter for your facility's format.

            **Alternative: Manual JSON Creation**

            For facilities not using MML, create the JSON database manually following the structure shown in the "Database Format" tab:

            1. **Define systems**: Top-level dictionary with system keys (SR, BR, VAC, etc.)
            2. **Add families**: Device families within each system
            3. **Specify fields**: Functional categories with ChannelNames lists
            4. **Add descriptions** (optional): Include ``_description`` fields for better semantic matching
            5. **Include metadata** (optional): Add setup information for filtering

            **Step 3: Validate Your Database**

            Check for structural issues and verify the database can be loaded:

            .. code-block:: bash

               # From my-control-assistant directory
               python src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/validate_database.py \
                  --database src/my_control_assistant/data/channel_databases/middle_layer.json

               # Show detailed statistics
               python src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/validate_database.py --verbose

            **Validation Checks:**

            - **Structure**: Valid JSON format, correct hierarchy levels
            - **ChannelNames**: All terminal fields have ChannelNames lists
            - **Metadata**: Optional fields properly formatted
            - **Database Loading**: Can be loaded by ``MiddleLayerDatabase`` class
            - **Statistics**: System/family/channel counts

            **Step 4: Preview Database Presentation**

            See how your database will be presented to the LLM agent during exploration:

            .. code-block:: bash

               # From my-control-assistant directory
               python src/my_control_assistant/data/tools/preview_database.py

            This shows you what information the agent sees at each level of exploration, helping you verify descriptions are clear and helpful.

            **Preview Output Example:**

            .. image:: ../_static/screenshots/channel_finder_db_preview_middlelayer.png
               :alt: Middle Layer Database Preview
               :align: center
               :width: 90%

            **Best Practices:**

            1. **Rich Descriptions**: Write clear descriptions at all levels—these are the primary guide for the LLM agent
            2. **Functional Organization**: Group channels by what they do (Monitor, Setpoint) not by location
            3. **Complete Metadata**: Include Units, DataType, and other metadata from your control system
            4. **Device Lists**: Add DeviceList metadata if you need sector/device filtering
            5. **Common Names**: Include friendly device names for better user experience
            6. **Consistent Structure**: Use same field names across families (e.g., always "Monitor" not "Readback")
            7. **Test Incrementally**: Build one system at a time, test it, then add the next

         .. tab-item:: Test Your Database

            **Interactive Testing & Benchmarking**

            Once your database is built and validated, test its functionality with the CLI for rapid iteration, then benchmark it for statistical evaluation.

            **Interactive CLI: Rapid Development Testing**

            Query your database interactively without running the full agent:

            .. code-block:: bash

               # From my-control-assistant directory
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/cli.py

            This launches an interactive terminal where you can:

            - Test queries against your channel database in real-time
            - Watch the agent explore the database with tool calls
            - Verify which channels are matched and why
            - Measure query execution time to optimize performance
            - Iterate on your database and see results immediately

            **Example queries to try:**

            - **Simple lookups**: "What's the beam current?" → ``SR:DCCT:Current``
            - **Functional queries**: "All BPM X positions" → All horizontal BPM readbacks
            - **Filtered queries**: "BPM positions in sector 1" → Sector-filtered results
            - **Multi-system**: "Vacuum pressure in booster" → ``BR`` system vacuum channels

            The CLI shows the agent's tool calls and reasoning, making it easy to spot issues with descriptions or database organization.

            **Benchmarking: Critical Validation Before Production**

            Benchmark datasets are **essential** for validating your channel finder before deployment. A benchmark that performs well during development with developer-created queries may completely fail in production when users with different mental models start querying the system.

            .. dropdown:: ⚠️ Critical Best Practice: Domain Expert Involvement
               :color: warning

               **DO NOT** rely solely on developer-created test queries. This is one of the most common failure modes in production systems:

               - **The Problem**: Developers unconsciously create queries that match their mental model of the system and the database structure they built
               - **The Result**: 95%+ accuracy in development, <60% accuracy in production when real users start querying
               - **The Solution**: Gather test queries from multiple domain experts and operators **before** finalizing your database

               **Why diverse queries matter:**

               - Different users have different mental models of the control system
               - Operators use different terminology than developers
               - Production queries often target edge cases not obvious to developers
               - Users query based on operational workflows, not database structure

               **Best practices for building benchmark datasets:**

               1. **Interview Domain Experts**: Talk to at least 3-5 different operators, physicists, or engineers who will use the system
               2. **Capture Real Workflows**: Ask them to describe their typical queries in their own words
               3. **Include Edge Cases**: Specifically ask about unusual or complex queries they might need
               4. **Diverse Terminology**: Look for variations in how different experts refer to the same equipment
               5. **Regular Updates**: Periodically add new queries from production usage to catch evolving patterns

            Once your database is ready and you have a diverse benchmark dataset from domain experts, run systematic benchmarks to measure accuracy:

            .. code-block:: bash

               # Run all benchmark queries
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py

               # Test specific queries (useful during development)
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py --queries 0,1

               # Compare model performance
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py --model anthropic/claude-sonnet

            **Benchmark Capabilities:**

            - **Statistical metrics**: Precision (accuracy of matches), recall (completeness), and F1 scores (harmonic mean)
            - **Success categorization**: Perfect matches (100% correct), partial matches (some correct), and failures
            - **Parallel execution**: Runs 5 queries concurrently by default to speed up large benchmark sets
            - **Incremental saves**: Results are saved after each query, so interruptions don't lose progress
            - **Consistency tracking**: Measures whether repeated queries produce the same results

            **Configuring Benchmarks:**

            The benchmark system is configured in ``config.yml`` with both global settings and pipeline-specific datasets:

            .. code-block:: yaml

               channel_finder:
                 # Active pipeline determines which benchmark dataset is used by default
                 pipeline_mode: middle_layer

                 pipelines:
                   middle_layer:
                     database:
                       type: middle_layer
                       path: src/my_control_assistant/data/channel_databases/middle_layer.json

                  # Benchmark dataset for this pipeline
                  benchmark:
                    dataset_path: src/my_control_assistant/data/benchmarks/datasets/middle_layer_benchmark.json
                    # Middle layer pipeline benchmark (35 queries)

               # Global benchmarking configuration
               benchmark:
                 # Execution settings
                 execution:
                   runs_per_query: 1                 # Number of times to run each query
                   delay_between_runs: 0             # Delay in seconds between runs
                   continue_on_error: true           # Continue even if some queries fail
                   max_concurrent_queries: 5         # Maximum parallel queries
                   query_selection: all              # "all" or specific queries like [0,1,2]

                 # Output settings
                 output:
                   results_dir: src/my_control_assistant/data/benchmarks/results
                   save_incremental: true            # Save results after each query
                   include_detailed_metrics: true    # Include detailed timing/cost metrics

                 # Evaluation thresholds
                 evaluation:
                   exact_match_weight: 1.0
                   partial_match_weight: 0.5

            You can override the dataset and other settings via CLI:

            .. code-block:: bash

               # Use a different dataset
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py \
                  --dataset src/my_control_assistant/data/benchmarks/datasets/custom_dataset.json

               # Run specific queries
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py --queries 0,1,5,10

               # Show detailed logs
               python src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/benchmarks/cli.py --verbose

            **When to use these tools:**

            - **During development**: Use the CLI to rapidly test queries as you build your database
            - **Before deployment**: Run full benchmarks with domain expert queries to validate accuracy meets production requirements (aim for >90% F1 score)
            - **Model selection**: Compare different LLM models to balance cost, speed, and accuracy for your specific use case
            - **Continuous validation**: Re-run benchmarks after database updates to ensure no regression in accuracy

            **Best Practices:**

            1. **Rich Descriptions**: Write detailed, semantic descriptions at all levels—they guide the agent
            2. **Functional Grouping**: Organize by function (Monitor, Setpoint) not location
            3. **Consistent Naming**: Use same field names across families for predictability
            4. **Iterative Testing**: Test incrementally as you build each system
            5. **Domain Expert Queries**: Gather test queries from multiple operators and experts
            6. **Regular Benchmarking**: Re-run benchmarks after database changes to catch regressions
            7. **CLI First**: Use interactive CLI for rapid iteration before running full benchmarks

2.1: OSPREY Framework Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The channel finder integrates into OSPREY as a **capability**—a reusable component that the agent orchestrator can plan and execute. The capability acts as a thin orchestration layer that connects the framework to the service layer, while all channel finding logic lives in ``services/channel_finder/``. This separation makes the service independently testable via CLI and benchmarks before agent integration. The template provides a complete implementation in ``src/my_control_assistant/capabilities/channel_finding.py``.

**Capability Architecture:**

.. code-block:: python

   @capability_node
   class ChannelFindingCapability(BaseCapability):
       name = "channel_finding"
       description = "Find control system channel addresses based on descriptions"
       provides = ["CHANNEL_ADDRESSES"]  # What this capability produces
       requires = []                      # What this capability needs (none)

**How the Agent Uses It:**

1. **Task Classification**: When the user asks about channels (e.g., "What's the beam current?"), the classifier identifies this requires channel finding

   - *Customization point:* Modify :meth:`~osprey.base.BaseCapability._create_classifier_guide` to change classification behavior with few-shot examples
   - See: :doc:`../developer-guides/04_infrastructure-components/03_classification-and-routing` for classification mechanics
   - Example: :ref:`Classifier Guide <hello-world-classifier-guide>` in Hello World tutorial

2. **Planning**: The orchestrator creates a plan that includes a ``channel_finding`` step

   - *Customization point:* Modify :meth:`~osprey.base.BaseCapability._create_orchestrator_guide` to influence when and how the capability is planned
   - See: :doc:`../developer-guides/04_infrastructure-components/04_orchestrator-planning` for orchestration logic
   - Example: :ref:`Orchestrator Guide <hello-world-orchestrator-guide>` in Hello World tutorial

3. **Execution**: The capability calls the service layer (``ChannelFinderService``) to find matching channels
4. **Context Storage**: Results are stored in the agent state as ``CHANNEL_ADDRESSES`` context
5. **Downstream Use**: Other capabilities (like ``channel_read``) consume the ``CHANNEL_ADDRESSES`` context

**Error Handling:**

The capability classifies errors for appropriate agent responses:

- ``ChannelNotFoundError``: Triggers re-planning with suggestions to refine the query
- ``ChannelFinderServiceError``: Critical error, aborts execution with diagnostic information

**Configuration:**

The capability reads ``config.yml`` to determine which pipeline to use (``in_context`` or ``hierarchical``). No code changes needed—just update the config:

.. code-block:: yaml

   channel_finder:
     pipeline_mode: in_context  # or "hierarchical"


Step 4: The Service Layer Pattern
=================================

A key architectural pattern: **separate business logic from framework orchestration**. This service layer pattern provides several critical benefits for production systems:

**Clean Boundaries:** Clear separation of concerns ensures that the service layer contains pure business logic and algorithms, while the capability layer handles state management and orchestration. No framework coupling exists in service code, making it easier to maintain and evolve.

**Independent Testing:** Service logic can be tested without framework overhead. For example, you can unit test the service directly:

.. code-block:: python

   service = ChannelFinderService()
   result = await service.find_channels("beam current")
   assert "SR:CURRENT:RB" in result.channels

**Reusability:** The same service can be used in multiple contexts—Osprey capabilities, standalone CLI tools, MCP servers, and web APIs. Your business logic stays portable across deployment scenarios. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   @mcp.tool()
   async def find_channels(query: str):
       service = ChannelFinderService()
       return await service.find_channels(query)


**Architecture Overview:**

.. code-block:: python

   # ===== SERVICE LAYER: src/my_control_assistant/services/channel_finder/ =====
   # Pure Python, no framework dependencies

   class ChannelFinderService:
       """Standalone service for channel finding."""

       def __init__(self):
           # Load database based on config
           self.pipeline = self._load_pipeline_from_config()

       async def find_channels(self, query: str) -> ChannelFinderResult:
           """
           Find channels matching natural language query.

           This is pure business logic - no AgentState, no StateManager.
           """
           result = await self.pipeline.process_query(query)

           return ChannelFinderResult(
               query=query,
               channels=[ChannelInfo(address=ch) for ch in result.channels],
               total_channels=len(result.channels),
               processing_notes=result.notes
           )

   # ===== CAPABILITY LAYER: src/my_control_assistant/capabilities/channel_finding.py =====
   # Framework integration only

   @capability_node
   class ChannelFindingCapability(BaseCapability):
       """Thin wrapper connecting service to framework."""

       name = "channel_finding"
       provides = ["CHANNEL_ADDRESSES"]

       async def execute(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
           search_query = self.get_task_objective()

           # Delegate to service layer
           service = ChannelFinderService()
           result = await service.find_channels(search_query)

           # Convert to framework context
           context = ChannelAddressesContext(
               channels=[ch.address for ch in result.channels],
               description=result.processing_notes
           )

           # Store in framework state
           return self.store_output_context(context)
