### Breaking Changes
- **`get_model_config()` signature changed**: `(model_name, service, model_type, config_path)` → `(model_name, config_path)`
  - **Impact**: Low - Framework model calls are internal and already updated
  - **User Action Required**: Only if you have custom application code using application-specific models
  - **Migration**:
    ```python
    # Old (if you have this in your application code):
    get_model_config('my_app', 'custom_model')

    # New:
    get_model_config('custom_model')
    ```
  - **Note**: Most users will not need to change anything - framework models (orchestrator, classifier, response, etc.) are handled internally

## [0.8.5] - 2025-11-10

### Fixed
- **Python Executor Configuration**: Removed deprecated 'framework' config nesting from python_executor components
- **Subprocess Execution**: Added `CONFIG_FILE` environment variable support for proper registry/context loading in subprocesses
  - Critical fix for execution scenarios where CWD ≠ project root
  - Updated `execution_wrapper.py` to pass config_path to registry initialization
  - Fixed `LocalCodeExecutor` to correctly access python_env_path from flat config structure
- **Exception Handling**: Improved exception chaining with `from e` for better error traceability across multiple modules
- **Configuration Access**: Updated `utils/config.py` to remove legacy nested format references

- **Formatting**: Applied automatic ruff formatting fixes for consistency
- **Logging**: Improved logging with reduced verbosity and structured formatting
- **CLI**: Extracted duplicate streaming logic into reusable helper method

## [0.8.4] - 2025-11-09

### Added
- **Registry Modes**: Introduced Standalone and Extend modes for application registries
  - **Extend Mode** (recommended): Applications extend framework defaults via `ExtendedRegistryConfig`
    - Framework components loaded automatically (memory, Python, time parsing, etc.)
    - Applications can add, exclude, or override framework components
    - Returned by `extend_framework_registry()` helper function
    - Reduces boilerplate and simplifies upgrades
  - **Standalone Mode** (advanced): Applications provide complete registry including all framework components
    - Framework registry is NOT loaded
    - Full control over all components
    - Used when `RegistryConfig` is returned directly (not via helper)
  - Mode detection is automatic based on registry type (`isinstance(config, ExtendedRegistryConfig)`)
- **New Class**: `ExtendedRegistryConfig` marker class for signaling Extend mode
  - Subclass of `RegistryConfig` with identical fields
  - Type-based detection enables automatic framework merging
  - Added to `__all__` exports in `osprey.registry`
- **New Helper Function**: `generate_explicit_registry_code()` for template generation
  - Generates complete registry Python code combining framework + app components
  - Used by CLI template system for creating explicit registries
  - Useful for applications that want full visibility of all components
  - Takes app metadata and component lists, returns formatted Python source code
- Comprehensive test suite for registry modes (500+ lines across 4 new test files)
  - `test_registry_modes.py`: Tests for Extend vs Standalone mode detection
  - `test_registry_loading.py`: Tests for registry loading mechanisms
  - `test_registry_helpers.py`: Tests for helper functions
  - `test_registry_validation.py`: Tests for registry validation

### Changed
- **Registry Helper**: `extend_framework_registry()` now returns `ExtendedRegistryConfig` instead of `RegistryConfig`
  - Backward compatible (ExtendedRegistryConfig is a subclass of RegistryConfig)
  - Type signature change enables automatic mode detection
  - Applications using type hints should update return type annotation
- Enhanced registry documentation with comprehensive coverage of both modes
  - Developer guide updated with mode selection guidance
  - API reference documentation expanded with ExtendedRegistryConfig details
  - Code examples updated to show ExtendedRegistryConfig return type

### Breaking Changes
- **RegistryManager Constructor**: Parameter changed from `registry_paths: List[str]` to `registry_path: Optional[str]`
  - **Impact**: Low - most applications use `initialize_registry()` which reads from config
  - **Migration**: Change `RegistryManager([path1, path2])` to `RegistryManager(path)` for single registry
  - **Rationale**: Simplified to single-application model matching actual usage patterns
  - Framework now supports one application registry per instance (loaded from `config.yml`)
- **Type Signature**: `extend_framework_registry()` return type changed to `ExtendedRegistryConfig`
  - **Impact**: Very low - backward compatible at runtime (subclass relationship)
  - **Migration**: Update type hints from `-> RegistryConfig` to `-> ExtendedRegistryConfig`
  - Only affects code using explicit type checking

### Removed
- Test file `test_path_based_discovery.py` (replaced with mode-specific tests)

### Developer Notes
- Registry system now uses type-based mode detection for cleaner separation of concerns
- Standalone mode enables minimal deployments and custom framework variations
- Extend mode remains the recommended default for >95% of applications
- See developer guide "Registry and Discovery" for complete mode selection guidance

## [0.8.3] - 2025-11-09

### Added
- **Docker Runtime Support**: Framework now supports both Docker and Podman container runtimes
  - New `runtime_helper.py` module for automatic runtime detection
  - Configuration setting `container_runtime` in `config.yml` (options: `auto`, `docker`, `podman`)
  - Environment variable `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` for per-command runtime override
  - Auto-detection prefers Docker first, falls back to Podman
  - Requires Docker Desktop 4.0+ or Podman 4.0+ (native compose support)
  - **User-friendly error messages**: Platform-specific guidance when Docker/Podman not running
    - macOS: "Open Docker Desktop from Applications" with menu bar icon hints
    - Linux: systemctl commands and docker group permissions
    - Windows: Start menu and system tray instructions
  - Comprehensive test suite for runtime detection and selection (33 tests)
- **Custom AI Provider Registration**: Applications can now register custom AI model providers through the registry system
  - Added `providers` parameter to `extend_framework_registry()` helper function
  - Added `exclude_providers` parameter to exclude framework providers
  - Added `override_providers` parameter to replace framework providers with custom implementations
  - Provider merging support in `RegistryManager._merge_application_with_override()`

### Changed
- **Container Management**: All deployment commands now use runtime abstraction layer
  - Updated `container_manager.py`: 6 functions now use runtime helper
  - Updated `health_cmd.py`: Container health checks are runtime-agnostic
  - Updated `interactive_menu.py`: Mount checking uses configured runtime
  - All compose operations work seamlessly with both Docker and Podman
  - **Fixed JSON parsing**: `osprey deploy status` now handles both Docker (NDJSON) and Podman (JSON array) output formats
- **Dependencies**: Removed Python `podman` and `podman-compose` packages
  - Container runtimes must be installed via system package managers
  - Framework uses CLI tools (`docker`/`podman` commands), not Python SDKs
  - Added installation documentation for both runtimes
- Enhanced registry helper functions to support provider registration parameters
- Updated developer guide documentation with provider registration examples

### Breaking Changes
- **Installation**: Users must install Docker Desktop 4.0+ or Podman 4.0+ separately
  - Python packages no longer provide container runtime functionality
  - See installation guide for platform-specific instructions
- **Note**: Existing Podman users are unaffected - auto-detection will find Podman if Docker not installed
