# Changelog

All notable changes to the Osprey Framework will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.9] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed
- **Registry**: Config-driven provider loading skips unused provider imports (#138)
  - Eliminates ~30s startup delay on air-gapped machines caused by timeout on provider network calls
  - Removes module-level `get_available_models(force_refresh=True)` from `argo.py` and `asksage.py`
- **Argo**: Add structured output handler for Argo provider
  - Argo API does not support the `response_format` parameter; structured output now uses direct httpx calls with JSON schema prompting
  - Includes `_clean_json_response()` to strip markdown fences and fix Python-style booleans
- **Tests**: Fix e2e LLM provider tests broken by config-driven provider filtering
  - Test config's `models` section only listed `openai`, causing all other providers to be skipped
  - Test fixtures now add `models` entries for all available providers
- **Tests**: Remove flaky `gpt-4o` from e2e test matrix (80% pass rate on react_agent due to extra fields in structured output)

### Changed
- **Docs**: Update citation to published APL Machine Learning paper (doi:10.1063/5.0306302)

### Added
- **CLI**: Add `--channel-finder-mode` and `--code-generator` options to `osprey init`
  - Options are included in manifest's `reproducible_command` for full project recreation
- **Capabilities**: Add capability-specific slash commands
  - Unregistered slash commands (e.g., `/beam:diagnostic`, `/verbose`) are forwarded to capabilities
  - `slash_command()` helper and `BaseCapability.slash_command()` method for reading commands
  - Commands are execution-scoped (reset each conversation turn)

## [0.10.8] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- **Skills**: Improve release workflow skill with full step-by-step guidance and CHANGELOG sanitization
- **Generators**: Add pluggable simulation backends for soft IOCs
  - Runtime backend loading from `config.yml` - change behavior without regenerating IOC code
  - Built-in backends: `passthrough` (no-op) and `mock_style` (archiver-like behavior)
  - `ChainedBackend` for composing multiple backends (base + overrides)
  - `SimulationBackend` protocol for custom physics implementations
  - Documentation guide for custom backend development

### Fixed
- **Templates**: Fix `pyproject.toml` template using wrong package search path
  - Template creates `src/<package_name>/` layout but configured `where = ["."]`
  - Changed to `where = ["src"]` so editable installs can find the package
- **Generators**: Fix `config_updater` functions returning wrong type
  - `set_control_system_type()`, `set_epics_gateway_config()`, `update_all_models()`, and `add_capability_react_to_config()` now return `(updated_content, preview)` tuple as expected by CLI callers
- **Channel Finder**: Fix string ChannelNames causing character-by-character iteration
  - MATLAB Middle Layer exports may produce bare strings (e.g., `"SR:DCCT"`) instead of single-element arrays
  - Without the fix, iterating over string produces `['S', 'R', ':', 'D', 'C', 'C', 'T']` instead of `['SR:DCCT']`
  - Normalizes strings to lists in `_extract_channels_from_field()` and `list_channel_names()`
- **Skills**: Fix release workflow skill name to follow `osprey-` naming convention

- **Documentation: Fixed RST docstring formatting**: Corrected docstring syntax in `BaseInfrastructureNode.get_current_task()` to use proper RST code block notation (eliminates Sphinx warnings)

### Added
- **Hierarchical Channel Finder: Custom Separator Overrides**: Per-node control of channel name separators
  - New `_separator` metadata field overrides default separators from naming pattern
  - Solves EPICS naming conventions with mixed delimiters (e.g., `:` for subdevices, `_` for suffixes, `.` for legacy subsystems)

  - **MCP Capability Generation Tests** (`test_mcp_capability_generation.py`): End-to-end MCP integration testing including server generation/launch, capability generation from live MCP server, registry integration, and query execution with LLM judge verification

### Changed
- **API Call Logging**: Enhanced with caller context tracking across all LLM-calling components. Logging metadata now includes capability/module/operation details for better debugging. Improved JSON serialization with Pydantic model support (mode='json') and better error visibility (warnings instead of silent failures)
- **Claude Code Generator Configuration**: Major simplification - profiles now directly specify phases to run instead of using planning_modes abstraction. Default profile changed from 'balanced' to 'fast'. Unified prompt building into single data-driven `_build_phase_prompt()` method. Reduced codebase by 564 lines through elimination of duplicate prompt builders and dead code
- **Registry Display**: Filtered infrastructure nodes table to exclude capability nodes (avoid duplication with Capabilities table), moved context classes to verbose-only mode, improved handling of tuple types in provides/requires fields
- **MCP Generator Error Handling**: Added pre-flight connectivity checks using httpx, much clearer error messages when server is not running, and actionable instructions in error messages
- **Test Infrastructure**: Added auto-reset registry fixtures in both unit and E2E test conftest files to ensure complete test isolation. Fixtures now reset registry, clear config caches, and clear CONFIG_FILE env var before/after each test to prevent state leakage. Removed manual registry reset calls from individual tests

### Removed
- **Claude Code Generator Profiles**: Removed 'balanced' profile (consolidated to 'fast' and 'robust' only)
- **Claude Code Generator Configuration**: Removed 'workflow_mode' setting (use direct 'phases' list specification), removed 'planning_modes' abstraction (profiles specify phases directly), removed dead code (_generate_direct, _generate_phased, _build_phase_options, 7 duplicate prompt builders)

### Fixed
- **Registry Import Timing**: Fixed module-level `get_registry()` calls that could cause initialization order issues. Moved registry access to runtime (function/method level) in python capability, time_range_parsing capability, generate_from_prompt, and hello_world_weather template
- **Python Executor Logging**: Replaced deprecated `get_streamer` with unified `get_logger` API in code generator node for consistent streaming support
- **MCP Generator Configuration**: Added proper model configuration validation with clear error messages when provider is not configured. Improved error handling with unused variable cleanup and better logging integration
- **Time Range Parsing Tests**: Added mock for `store_output_context` to bypass registry validation, allowing tests to run independently of registry state. Removed obsolete decorator integration tests that were duplicating coverage
- **Tutorial E2E Tests**: Relaxed over-strict plot count assertion (1+ PNG files instead of 2+) to accommodate both single-figure and multi-figure plotting approaches
- **Claude Code Generator Tests**: Refactored to skip low-level prompt building tests (implementation details now covered by E2E tests). Improved test maintainability by focusing on behavior rather than internal methods
- **E2E Test Documentation**: Complete rewrite of tests/e2e/README.md with clearer structure, better isolation guidance, and comprehensive examples. Added warnings about running E2E tests separately from unit tests
- **Documentation**: Updated all Claude Code generator documentation to reflect simplified configuration model. Restructured generator-claude.rst with improved UX using collapsible dropdowns and tabbed sections. Updated all examples to use 'fast' as default profile

  - Now returns a list when multiple contexts of the same type exist: `{"CURRENT_WEATHER": [ctx1, ctx2]}`
  - Single contexts still returned as objects for backward compatibility: `{"CURRENT_WEATHER": ctx_obj}`
  - Capabilities can check `isinstance(context, list)` to detect and handle multiple contexts

### Breaking Changes
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: `BaseCapabilityContext.get_access_details()` signature simplified
  - **Old:** `get_access_details(self, key_name: Optional[str] = None)` with defensive fallback
  - **New:** `get_access_details(self, key: str)` - key parameter is required
  - **Reason:** Framework always provides the key; optional parameter was unnecessary defensive programming
  - **Impact:** Custom context classes must update signature
  - **Migration:** Remove `Optional[str] = None` and fallback logic; use `key` parameter directly
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: `BaseCapabilityContext.get_summary()` signature simplified
  - **Old:** `get_summary(self, key: str)` - required the storage key
  - **New:** `get_summary(self)` - no parameters needed
  - **Reason:** Summaries describe the context data, not storage details
  - **Impact:** Custom context classes must remove `key` parameter
  - **Migration:** Remove `key` parameter from method signature
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: `ContextManager.get_summaries()` now returns `list[dict]` instead of `dict[str, Any]`
  - Simplifies the API by eliminating flattened key format (e.g., `"CONTEXT_TYPE.key"`)
  - Each summary dict already contains a `"type"` field for identification
  - More natural format for UI/LLM consumption
  - Updated 4 consumer files: `respond_node.py`, `clarify_node.py`, `memory.py`, `response_generation.py`

### Migration Notes
- **Early Access Phase**: This is an acceptable breaking change as the framework is in early access (0.9.x)
- **For Capability Developers (Cardinality)**: Replace `isinstance(context, list)` checks with cardinality constraints
  - Old: `constraints=["PV_ADDRESSES"]` + manual `isinstance` check
  - New: `constraints=[("PV_ADDRESSES", "single")]` - framework handles validation
- **For Capability Developers (Multi-Context)**: Add `isinstance(context, list)` validation after extracting contexts to ensure your capability behavior matches expectations (only if not using cardinality constraints)
- **For get_summaries() Consumers**: Update code to iterate over list instead of dict.items()
  - Old: `for key, summary in summaries.items()`
  - New: `for summary in summaries: context_type = summary.get('type')`

  - **User Action Required**: Only if you have custom application code using application-specific models
  - **Migration**:
    ```python
    # Old (if you have this in your application code):
    get_model_config('my_app', 'custom_model')

    # New:
    get_model_config('custom_model')
    ```
  - **Note**: Most users will not need to change anything - framework models (orchestrator, classifier, response, etc.) are handled internally

## [0.8.5] - 2025-11-10

### Fixed

- **CLI**: Extracted duplicate streaming logic into reusable helper method

## [0.8.4] - 2025-11-09

### Added
- **Registry Modes**: Introduced Standalone and Extend modes for application registries
  - **Extend Mode** (recommended): Applications extend framework defaults via `ExtendedRegistryConfig`
    - Framework components loaded automatically (memory, Python, time parsing, etc.)
    - Applications can add, exclude, or override framework components
    - Returned by `extend_framework_registry()` helper function
    - Reduces boilerplate and simplifies upgrades
  - **Standalone Mode** (advanced): Applications provide complete registry including all framework components
    - Framework registry is NOT loaded
    - Full control over all components
    - Used when `RegistryConfig` is returned directly (not via helper)
  - Mode detection is automatic based on registry type (`isinstance(config, ExtendedRegistryConfig)`)
- **New Class**: `ExtendedRegistryConfig` marker class for signaling Extend mode
  - Subclass of `RegistryConfig` with identical fields
  - Type-based detection enables automatic framework merging
  - Added to `__all__` exports in `osprey.registry`
- **New Helper Function**: `generate_explicit_registry_code()` for template generation
  - Generates complete registry Python code combining framework + app components
  - Used by CLI template system for creating explicit registries
  - Useful for applications that want full visibility of all components
  - Takes app metadata and component lists, returns formatted Python source code
- Comprehensive test suite for registry modes (500+ lines across 4 new test files)
  - `test_registry_modes.py`: Tests for Extend vs Standalone mode detection
  - `test_registry_loading.py`: Tests for registry loading mechanisms
  - `test_registry_helpers.py`: Tests for helper functions
  - `test_registry_validation.py`: Tests for registry validation

### Changed
- **Registry Helper**: `extend_framework_registry()` now returns `ExtendedRegistryConfig` instead of `RegistryConfig`
  - Backward compatible (ExtendedRegistryConfig is a subclass of RegistryConfig)
  - Type signature change enables automatic mode detection
  - Applications using type hints should update return type annotation
- Enhanced registry documentation with comprehensive coverage of both modes
  - Developer guide updated with mode selection guidance
  - API reference documentation expanded with ExtendedRegistryConfig details
  - Code examples updated to show ExtendedRegistryConfig return type

### Breaking Changes
- **RegistryManager Constructor**: Parameter changed from `registry_paths: List[str]` to `registry_path: Optional[str]`
  - **Impact**: Low - most applications use `initialize_registry()` which reads from config
  - **Migration**: Change `RegistryManager([path1, path2])` to `RegistryManager(path)` for single registry
  - **Rationale**: Simplified to single-application model matching actual usage patterns
  - Framework now supports one application registry per instance (loaded from `config.yml`)
- **Type Signature**: `extend_framework_registry()` return type changed to `ExtendedRegistryConfig`
  - **Impact**: Very low - backward compatible at runtime (subclass relationship)
  - **Migration**: Update type hints from `-> RegistryConfig` to `-> ExtendedRegistryConfig`
  - Only affects code using explicit type checking

### Removed
- Test file `test_path_based_discovery.py` (replaced with mode-specific tests)

### Developer Notes
- Registry system now uses type-based mode detection for cleaner separation of concerns
- Standalone mode enables minimal deployments and custom framework variations
- Extend mode remains the recommended default for >95% of applications
- See developer guide "Registry and Discovery" for complete mode selection guidance

## [0.8.3] - 2025-11-09

### Added

  - New `runtime_helper.py` module for automatic runtime detection
  - Configuration setting `container_runtime` in `config.yml` (options: `auto`, `docker`, `podman`)
  - Environment variable `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` for per-command runtime override
  - Auto-detection prefers Docker first, falls back to Podman
  - Requires Docker Desktop 4.0+ or Podman 4.0+ (native compose support)
  - **User-friendly error messages**: Platform-specific guidance when Docker/Podman not running
    - macOS: "Open Docker Desktop from Applications" with menu bar icon hints
    - Linux: systemctl commands and docker group permissions
    - Windows: Start menu and system tray instructions
  - Comprehensive test suite for runtime detection and selection (33 tests)

  - Updated `health_cmd.py`: Container health checks are runtime-agnostic
  - Updated `interactive_menu.py`: Mount checking uses configured runtime
  - All compose operations work seamlessly with both Docker and Podman
  - **Fixed JSON parsing**: `osprey deploy status` now handles both Docker (NDJSON) and Podman (JSON array) output formats
- **Dependencies**: Removed Python `podman` and `podman-compose` packages
  - Container runtimes must be installed via system package managers
  - Framework uses CLI tools (`docker`/`podman` commands), not Python SDKs
  - Added installation documentation for both runtimes
- Enhanced registry helper functions to support provider registration parameters
- Updated developer guide documentation with provider registration examples

### Breaking Changes
- **Installation**: Users must install Docker Desktop 4.0+ or Podman 4.0+ separately
  - Python packages no longer provide container runtime functionality
  - See installation guide for platform-specific instructions
- **Note**: Existing Podman users are unaffected - auto-detection will find Podman if Docker not installed
