address,description,family_name,instances,sub_channel
# === STANDALONE CHANNELS (no templating) ===
# Use for unique channels that don't belong to a device family
# Just fill in address and description, leave family_name/instances/sub_channel empty
BeamCurrent,Total electron beam current measured in milliamps,,,
VacuumPressure,Main beamline vacuum pressure in Torr,,,
RFFrequency,Radio frequency cavity frequency in MHz,,,
# === DEVICE FAMILY TEMPLATES (Simple) ===
# Use for device families with multiple instances
# Pattern: {instance:02d} will be replaced with 01, 02, 03, etc.
# Pattern: {sub_channel} will be replaced with the sub_channel value from this row
# All rows with same family_name will be grouped into one template
BPM{instance:02d}{sub_channel},Horizontal position reading from BPM {instance} in millimeters,BPM,10,XPosition
BPM{instance:02d}{sub_channel},Vertical position reading from BPM {instance} in millimeters,BPM,10,YPosition
# === DEVICE FAMILY TEMPLATES (With Control + Readback) ===
# Common pattern for devices with setpoint and readback
Valve{instance:02d}{sub_channel},Valve {instance} position command (0=closed 1=open),Valve,8,SetPoint
Valve{instance:02d}{sub_channel},Valve {instance} actual position (0=closed 1=open),Valve,8,ReadBack
# === DEVICE FAMILY TEMPLATES (Single Sub-channel) ===
# Use when devices only have one channel per instance
PowerSupply{instance:02d}{sub_channel},Output voltage of power supply {instance} in Volts,PowerSupply,3,Voltage
# === DEVICE FAMILY TEMPLATES (Multi-Axis) ===
# For multi-axis devices, just name your sub-channels explicitly (XSetPoint, YSetPoint, etc.)
# No automatic axis detection - keep it simple!
