"""Execution Control Configuration for Python Executor Service.

This module provides specialized execution control configuration for the Python
executor service, with particular focus on EPICS (Experimental Physics and
Industrial Control System) integration and security policies. It defines execution
modes that determine the level of system access and control permissions available
to executed Python code.

The module implements a security-conscious approach to execution control, providing
clear separation between read-only operations (safe for automated execution) and
write operations (requiring additional approval and oversight). This is particularly
important in scientific and industrial control environments where code execution
can have real-world physical consequences.

Key Components:
    - **ExecutionMode**: Enumeration of available execution environments with
      different security and access profiles
    - **ExecutionControlConfig**: Configuration class that determines execution
      mode selection based on code analysis and security policies
    - **Configuration Utilities**: Helper functions for creating and validating
      execution control configurations

The execution control system integrates with the static code analysis pipeline
to automatically determine appropriate execution environments based on the
operations detected in generated code, while providing override capabilities
for manual control when needed.

.. note::
   This module is specifically designed for EPICS integration but can be extended
   for other control systems or security-sensitive environments.

.. warning::
   Write-enabled execution modes can perform system operations with real-world
   consequences. Ensure proper approval workflows are configured before enabling
   write access in production environments.

   :class:`osprey.services.python_executor.models.ExecutionModeConfig` : Container configuration
   :class:`osprey.services.python_executor.analysis.node` : Analysis node using these modes

Examples:
    Basic execution control configuration::

        >>> config = ExecutionControlConfig(epics_writes_enabled=False)
        >>> mode = config.get_execution_mode(
        ...     has_epics_writes=True,
        ...     has_epics_reads=True
        ... )
        >>> print(f"Selected mode: {mode}")
        Selected mode: ExecutionMode.READ_ONLY

    Enabling write operations with proper safeguards::

        >>> write_config = ExecutionControlConfig(epics_writes_enabled=True)
        >>> mode = write_config.get_execution_mode(
        ...     has_epics_writes=True,
        ...     has_epics_reads=False
        ... )
        >>> print(f"Write mode: {mode}")
        Write mode: ExecutionMode.WRITE_ACCESS

    Configuration validation::

        >>> warnings = config.validate()
        >>> if warnings:
        ...     print(f"Configuration warnings: {warnings}")

    This enum defines the available execution environments for Python code execution,

    are designed to provide appropriate isolation and control for different types
    of operations, particularly in scientific and industrial control environments.

    The execution modes form a security hierarchy from most restrictive (READ_ONLY)
    to least restrictive (WRITE_ACCESS), allowing fine-grained control over the
