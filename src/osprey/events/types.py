"""Typed event classes for Osprey event streaming.

This module defines all event types used in Osprey's unified event streaming system.
Events are dataclasses that serialize to dicts for transport via LangGraph streaming.

Event Categories:
- Status Events: General status updates during execution
- Phase Lifecycle Events: Phase transitions in agent execution
- Capability Events: Capability execution lifecycle
- LLM Events: LLM API call tracking
- Tool/Code Events: External tool and code execution
- Control Flow Events: Approval workflow
- Result Events: Final execution results and errors

Usage:
    from osprey.events.types import StatusEvent, OspreyEvent

    event = StatusEvent(message="Processing...", component="router")
