"""Approval Evaluators for Capability-Specific Business Logic.

This module contains evaluator classes that implement capability-specific
business logic for determining approval requirements. Each evaluator encapsulates
the rules and decision-making process for its respective capability, providing
clear separation between configuration and business logic.

The evaluator pattern allows capabilities to define their own approval rules
while maintaining consistent interfaces and behavior. This design supports
complex approval scenarios with multiple factors and conditions.

Key Features:
    - Capability-specific approval decision logic
    - Structured decision results with reasoning
    - Support for multiple approval modes and conditions
    - Extensible architecture for new capability types
    - Comprehensive logging for audit trails

Evaluator Classes:
    - PythonExecutionApprovalEvaluator: Python code execution approval logic
    - MemoryApprovalEvaluator: Memory operation approval logic

Examples:
    Python execution evaluation::

        >>> from .config_models import PythonExecutionApprovalConfig, ApprovalMode
        >>> config = PythonExecutionApprovalConfig(enabled=True, mode=ApprovalMode.EPICS_WRITES)
        >>> evaluator = PythonExecutionApprovalEvaluator(config)
        >>> decision = evaluator.evaluate(has_epics_writes=True, has_epics_reads=False)
        >>> print(f"Needs approval: {decision.needs_approval}")
        >>> print(f"Reasoning: {decision.reasoning}")

    Memory operation evaluation::

        >>> from .config_models import MemoryApprovalConfig
        >>> config = MemoryApprovalConfig(enabled=True)
        >>> evaluator = MemoryApprovalEvaluator(config)
        >>> decision = evaluator.evaluate(operation_type="save")
        >>> print(f"Approval required: {decision.needs_approval}")

.. note::
   Evaluators are stateless and thread-safe. They can be created once and
   reused for multiple evaluations with the same configuration.

class PythonExecutionApprovalEvaluator:
    """Business logic evaluator for Python code execution approval decisions.

    Implements capability-specific rules for determining when Python code
    execution requires human approval. The evaluator supports multiple approval
    modes ranging from disabled (no approval) to all_code (approval for everything).

    The evaluation logic considers both the configured approval mode and the
    specific characteristics of the code being evaluated, such as EPICS operations.
    This provides granular control over approval requirements based on operational
    risk assessment.

    Supported Approval Modes:
        - DISABLED: No approval required regardless of code content
        - EPICS_WRITES: Approval required only for code with EPICS write operations
        - ALL_CODE: Approval required for all Python code execution
