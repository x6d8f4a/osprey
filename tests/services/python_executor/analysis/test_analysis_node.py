"""Placeholder for Python Executor Analysis Node Tests.

NOTE: The analysis node cannot be meaningfully unit tested because:
- It's a LangGraph node requiring full workflow context  
- The node (226 lines) integrates pattern detection, policy analysis, and approval logic
- Mocking would bypass all actual analysis code, providing 0% coverage
- Testing mocks instead of real code gives false confidence

EXISTING COVERAGE: The analysis node is comprehensively tested via integration tests.

Integration Tests (tests/integration/test_python_executor_service.py):
- TestAnalysisAndSecurity::test_channel_write_detection (line 285)
  * Tests detection of control system write operations
  * Validates analysis triggers appropriate handling
  
- TestAnalysisAndSecurity::test_channel_read_allowed (line 319)
  * Tests that read operations are correctly classified
  * Validates read vs write operation distinction
  
- TestAnalysisAndSecurity::test_security_risk_detection (line 351)
  * Tests detection of security risks in generated code
  * Validates security analysis and risk classification
  
- TestApprovalWorkflow::test_approval_with_channel_writes (line 455)
  * Tests analysis integration with approval workflow
  * Validates write detection triggers approval when configured
  
- TestApprovalWorkflow::test_complete_approval_resume_workflow (line 528)
  * End-to-end: analysis → approval → execution
  * Validates analysis results drive approval decisions

Service-Level Tests (tests/services/python_executor/):
- test_pattern_detection_integration.py
  * Tests pattern detection for EPICS operations
  * Validates AST-based code analysis
  
- test_result_validation_integration.py
  * Tests result validation and security checks
  * Integration with analyzer node logic

This file serves as documentation of why unit tests are not appropriate here,
per COVERAGE_EXPANSION_PLAN.md guidance on "files genuinely hard to test in isolation".
