"""
Regression tests for hierarchical channel finder optional levels navigation.

These tests verify correct behavior when navigating optional hierarchy levels,
particularly edge cases where signals exist directly at a level that has an
optional child level (e.g., signals that skip an optional subdevice level).

Key scenarios tested:
- Direct signals at device level should NOT appear as subdevice options
- build_channels_from_selections() correctly handles missing optional levels
- Separator cleanup is applied when optional levels are skipped
- Channel map generation produces correct channels for both paths

These tests serve as regression tests to ensure the optional level navigation
logic continues to work correctly.
